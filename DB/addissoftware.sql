year, members of the WordPress community (users, site builders, extenders, and contributors) provide valuable feedback through an annual survey. Key takeaways and trends that emerge from this survey often find their way into the annual <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/state-of-the-word-2022/\">State of the Word</a> address, are shared in the public project blogs, and can influence the direction and strategy for the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put: this survey helps those who build WordPress understand more about how the software is used, and by whom. The survey also helps leaders in the WordPress open source project learn more about our contributors’ experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that your WordPress experience is represented in the 2022 survey results, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/en-2022\">take the 2022 annual survey now.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/en-2022\">Take the 2022 Survey (English)</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also take the survey in <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/fr-2022\">French</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/de-2022\">German</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/it-2022\">Italian</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/jp-2022\">Japanese</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/ru-2022\">Russian</a>, or <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/es-2022\">Spanish</a>, thanks to the efforts of WordPress polyglot contributors. These are the most frequently installed languages based on the number of WordPress downloads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey will be open through the end of 2022, and then WordPress plans to publish the results sometime in 2023. This year, the survey questions have been refreshed for more effortless survey flow, completion, and analysis. Some questions have been removed, while a few new ones are now present, reflecting the present and future of WordPress. If you’re looking for the analysis of the 2021 survey results, those will also be shared in early 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spread the word</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help spread the word about the survey by sharing it with your network, through Slack, or within your social media accounts. The more people who complete the survey and share their experience with WordPress, the more the project as a whole will benefit in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Security and privacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data security and privacy are paramount to the WordPress project and community. With this in mind, all data will be anonymized: no email addresses nor IP addresses will be associated with published results. To learn more about WordPress.org’s privacy practices, view the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/privacy/\">privacy policy</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thank you</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to the following WordPress contributors for assisting with the annual survey project, including question creation, strategy, survey build-out, and translation:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\">dansoschin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/_dorsvenabili/\">_dorsvenabili</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/angelasjin/\">angelasjin</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/arkangel/\">arkangel</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/audrasjb/\">audrasjb</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/atachibana/\">atachibana</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bjmcsherry/\">bjmcsherry</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\">chanthaboune</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/eidolonnight/\">eidolonnight</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fernandot/\">fernandot</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fierevere/\">fierevere</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/fxbenard/\">fxbenard</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jdy68/\">jdy68</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jpantani/\">jpantani</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/laurlittle/\">laurlittle</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nao/\">nao</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nielslange/\">nielslange</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/peiraisotta/\">peiraisotta</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piermario/\">piermario</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/rmartinezduque/\">rmartinezduque</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/santanainniss/\">santanainniss</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"14062\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"People of WordPress: Huanyi Chuang\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/people-of-wordpress-huanyi-chuang/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 20:09:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13562\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:144:\"The latest People of WordPress story features Huanyi Chuang, from #Taiwan, on his journey to become a digital marketer and front end developer. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Abha Thakor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11499:\"\n<p><strong>This month we feature Huanyi (Eric) Chuang, a front end developer from Taiwan, who helps connect local groups to WordPress and the worldwide open source community.

To this day, he uses child themes to deliver truly custom designs and functionality for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in his career, Huanyi moved into digital marketing, integrating sites with massive ad platforms like Google and Facebook. This led him to learn to work with tracking code and JavaScript. He also began his learning journey in HTML, CSS, and PHP, to be able to improve his development skills and customize child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meetups bring together software users to learn together</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-1.jpg?fit=600%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Huanyi and a koala.\" class=\"wp-image-13476\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-1.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Huanyi pictured in Australia during one of his travels meeting a koala bear.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When Huanyi had a problem with a client&#8217;s site, he looked to WordPress meetups near where he lived in <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Taipei-WordPress/\">Taipei</a> to help find the solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>“When I encountered an issue with the custom archive pages, a local meetup announcement showed up on my WordPress dashboard</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Huanyi Chuang</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At the meetup, he met more experienced WordPress users and developers there, who answered his questions and helped him learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I encountered an issue with the custom archive pages, a local meetup announcement showed up on my WordPress dashboard. That was my original connection with the local community,” Huanyi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community gave Huanyi a chance to connect with people, feed his curiosity about the software, and join a circle of people he could share this interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, he thought meetups were an opportunity to source new clients, and he took his business cards to every event. However, he soon found that these events offered him the opportunity to make friends and share knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From then on, Huanyi started focusing more on what he could give to these events and networks, making new friends, and listening to people. This led him to share as a meetup speaker his own commercial website management experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The road to WordCamp</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was going to his first meetup and then getting involved with WordCamps that changed Huanyi&#8217;s whole relationship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-2.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Huanyi pictured on an outing, stood next to a white car.\" class=\"wp-image-13477\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-2.jpg?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, he took the step to help as an organizer, having joined the Taoyuan Meetup in Taiwan. He played several parts across the organizing team, and the welcoming feeling he got in every situation encouraged him to get more involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recalls meeting new friends from different fields and other countries, which gave him a great sense of achievement and strengthened his passion for participating in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the team started this meetup, numbers were much lower than in the group in the city of Taipei, but they were not disheartened and gradually grew the local WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They created a pattern of ‘multiple organizers,’ which spread the workload and grew friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>“Being connected to and from meetups is the most valuable part of the community. Having these friends makes me gather more information. We share information and benefit from others’ information, and thus we gain more trust in each other. With such credibility, we share more deeply and build deeper relations.”</strong> </p>\n<cite>Huanyi Chuang</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the pandemic, the meetup met every month and grew to become the second largest meetup in Taiwan. Huanyi also contributed to the WordPress community as an organizer of WordCamp Taipei 2018 in the speaker team and lead organizer of <a href=\"https://taiwan.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Taiwan 2021</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>So why should you join the community?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Huanyi, you will always have something to take home with you. It might be new information or experiences. It might be plugins or theme ideas. But most of all, it is the chance to meet fascinating people and make new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Huanyi’s message to other contributors:<br>&#8220;Keep participating, and you will find more you can achieve than you expect.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that long-term participation will &#8216;let you feel the humanity behind the project&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Localize: the road ahead for WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-3.jpg?resize=900%2C675&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Huanyi standing on a sandy beach.\" class=\"wp-image-13478\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-3.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-3.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-3.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Huanyi believes WordPress has the power to break down the barriers between designers, project managers, developers, marketers, writers, and publishers. In Taiwan, he said WordPress is &#8216;a common protocol&#8217; that lets people from all of these disciplines work and communicate together more easily than they ever have before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why he works on and encourages others to localize plugins today. He believes localization of the software is the foundation for the extension of the WordPress community as it enables people to ‘Flex their Freedom’ in a language they speak!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has helped to organize online events around previous <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huanyi said: “I think it&#8217;s important to localize WordPress because its very concept of ‘open source’ means that people can access it freely. In another way, free from the monopoly of knowledge and speech. To achieve it, it&#8217;s important that people can access it with their own language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Localization is the foundation of the extension of WordPress community because it helps people using different languages to access the project and lowers the hurdle to understand how things work.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/no249a002/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>no249a002</a> for sharing his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>), Adeeb Malik (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/adeebmalik/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>adeebmalik</a>) for research, interviews, and contributing to this feature article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>People of WordPress</em> series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:27]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top of November, a new major release for WordPress shipped. That was WordPress 6.1. I know I talked about it basically nonstop. Then two weeks later, there was a new minor release for WordPress. It was WordPress 6.1.1, which I did not talk about at all. Way back in episode four of this podcast, I dug into the overall release cycle and what someone could expect from a high-level logistics aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today we&#8217;re gonna take a quick look at minor releases in particular. Just as a general heads up, I always want to lean into sports metaphors when I&#8217;m talking about releases, and I think it&#8217;s because of the words major and minor. And so, I&#8217;ve done my level best to not include that in any of my explanations today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do have one, I do have one that&#8217;s a sports thing. So just if you don&#8217;t like sports, know that it&#8217;s just one little bit and we&#8217;ll try to be carefully quick around it together. All right, so minor releases. You may have noticed that I don&#8217;t mention minor releases nearly as often as I mention major releases. And yet, most of the time, when we have a major release of WordPress, there&#8217;s a minor release that gets started almost immediately after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first major versus minor. Major releases in WordPress happen roughly three times a year, give or take a release. Inside a major release, you will find that we include features, so– brand new abilities, enhancements, which you can generally call improvements to existing abilities, and also any bug fix that we can find, big or small, we&#8217;ll take &#8217;em all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So minor releases in WordPress happen about four or five times a year on average. Minor releases include patches for issues introduced in the major release and any bug fix that doesn&#8217;t add or change functionality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re with me so far, you probably have noted that there&#8217;s basically always at least one minor release per major release. And you might have also noted that I said minors include patches for issues we introduced in a major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if I were hearing this with fresh ears, the first thing I would wonder is, okay, so if you start working on the minor right after you release the major to deal with issues you know you introduced in the major– why just not ship the major while there are bugs in it? Great question. I&#8217;m glad you asked. So there are a few things worth knowing here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there is this concept of “ship and iterate,” which is present in both agile and open source. The idea is that we ship software as soon as we have confidence that what is in the release is non-breaking and represents our best guests at a better experience for our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that is out there, we use feedback on the initial release to quickly iterate and ship another release. That way, we don&#8217;t hold back any good features. And since we already planned the immediate minor, any major issues that show up can be fixed in as little as two weeks. Secondly, there is the concept that with many eyes, all bugs are shallow, which is primarily present in open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea here is that with enough people looking at a problem, that problem doesn&#8217;t stand a chance. So when a release is shipped in a workable state but with interactions that could use some refinement, the fastest way to find those refinements is to take it to the community of WordPress users and developers and invite them to co-create this CMS with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which touches on my final thought. The concept of the user as co-creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we think about the development and evolution of our software as a team effort, then we can think of the people who use our software as what&#8217;s called the “Twelfth Man” That&#8217;s in quotes, and I will, I&#8217;ll leave a link to that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sports, this refers to the fans. And if you&#8217;ve ever been to a live sporting event or played in any, you will know that the cheering and jeering from fans turns into this distinct motivating entity all its own. As a whole team or individual member, you know what you have to do. You know what you need to do in a game, but there&#8217;s something about that chaotic, loud roar of feedback that just brings life to what you&#8217;re doing, and that&#8217;s how I see our community of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at the end of the day, the answer to the question of ‘why so many releases’ and the follow-up question of ‘why tolerate stable imperfection’ is largely the same. To get features into the hands of our users quickly so that we can always be breathing life into this CMS we care so much about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that answers your questions about our release cadence, and if you didn&#8217;t come into this podcast having any questions about release cadences at all, I hope this new information brings a little extra light to the complexity of working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big thing number one is that the State of the Word has been announced and is scheduled for December 15th. It&#8217;s a little earlier in the day than in past iterations, so I hope we get a new crew of listeners tuning in at the same time. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that in the show notes, or you can pop over to wordpress.org/news to see the announcement for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big thing number two is that team rep nominations are open on most teams right now. So if organization and people wrangling are high on your list of ways you can give back to WordPress, head on over to the team you contribute to and see how you raise your hand for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then big thing number three is that big-picture goals, hopes, and timelines are being gathered, and I will ship those shortly after the start of the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will give us all an idea of where we want to focus our attention to ensure that WordPress continues to grow toward the future. You can keep an eye out for that on make.wordpress.org/project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13996\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"The Month in WordPress – October 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/the-month-in-wordpress-october-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 22 Nov 2022 11:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13988\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:224:\"With the end of the year fast approaching, the WordPress project has not slowed down.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 18 months ago, the Openverse project became part of the WordPress open source project, and at roughly the same time, we also welcomed the Photo Directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since that time, we&#8217;ve seen growth in teams supporting both of these initiatives. But if you&#8217;re not involved in the day-to-day, it can be hard to know how those two things fit together or if they fit together at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, let&#8217;s take a brief tour of those two projects and why they came to be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my timeline, work on the Photo Directory started before the work on Openverse, so that&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For as long as I can remember, the WordPress community has raised the need for WordPress-first ways to have and host GPL-compatible photos for use in themes, site builds, and marketing efforts as a whole. As recently as 2016, that was still coming up as a question at various flagship events and among the career photographers that contribute their time to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in 2017 and 2018, as attention started to turn toward rebuilding the CMS using blocks, it dropped down the list of priority items. But it never really went away as a thing that people were hoping we could do for the project as a whole. So in 2019, it was becoming clear that having open source-first tools of all varieties for people whose businesses were built on our software would help broaden the availability of the open source freedoms we believe in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This began the work on the Photo Directory with the intention of providing a GPL-friendly, community-driven repository of images. It has since launched, and we have photos in it now. We have a whole team around it. It&#8217;s wonderful. But that is how that all kind of came to be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Openverse, on the other hand, was launched as CC Search in 2019 with the laudable mandate to increase the discoverability and accessibility of open access media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Late in 2020, while work on the Photo Directory was underway, Matt shared with me that the team was looking for a new project home. When I first met with them, they shared an overview of the product, which they shorthanded as an open source search engine that searches openly licensed images. We were working on a repo of openly licensed images, so clearly, this was all written in the stars. And so you might be asking yourself at this point, great, how does it work together?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think for most of us, the timeline there kind of covers the question of what is the difference between these two things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But because I never know which of you will want to strike up a conversation about open source on an elevator, I&#8217;ve also got the elevator pitch version.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Openverse is an open source search engine that searches, indexes, and aggregates copy left media from across the web using sources such as WordPress&#8217;s Photo Directory, Flickr&#8217;s CC Tagged Media, and Wikimedia, to name just a few.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key difference between the Photo Directory and Openverse is that in order to contribute to the Photo Directory, now that it&#8217;s all built, that&#8217;s mostly done by submitting photos or reviewing photos. So you don&#8217;t really need to be a developer to join in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Openverse is not only a developer-centric contribution opportunity, but it also uses a different tech stack than WordPress as a whole. So it&#8217;s a good place for folks to go if they&#8217;re looking to broaden their horizons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s your elevator pitch of what Openverse is and how it uses the Photo Directory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a couple of ways that you can get involved with these two projects. For the Photo Directory, as I mentioned at the start, you can always contribute photos, and they could always use more photo contributions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll include a link to the submission guidelines in the show notes below, and as I mentioned, it is a no-code way to give back to the WordPress project. So no code, development environments, and testing skills are required. The Photo Directory team also could always use more contributors to help with the moderating of photo submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll link to their making WordPress page in the show notes as well so that you can get started there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned before, Openverse is an aggregator, so it doesn&#8217;t host any media itself, but it is always accepting suggestions for new GPL-compatible media providers. I&#8217;ll link the area where you can leave suggestions in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you are more code inclined, there&#8217;s an open issue for adding Openverse browsing to the block editor right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll link that issue in the show notes in case you thought to yourself, gosh, that sounds like my most favorite thing to do. That is where you can go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you missed it, WordPress 6.1 is now available. It launched on November 1st. Late, late, late in the day, and so it was easy to miss if you&#8217;re used to seeing it at a particular time. We were about six hours later than usual. But if you go to wordpress.org/download, you can get your own copy there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list of big things is that the Docs team had a contributor day. It was excellent. There&#8217;s a recap post up.

For example, the Image block placeholder displays custom borders and duotone filters even before selecting an image.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compose richer lists and quotes with inner blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The List and Quote blocks now support inner blocks, allowing for more flexible and rich compositions like adding headings inside your Quote blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More responsive text with fluid typography</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers working with block themes and/or <code>theme.json</code>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-8-3-august/#fluid-typography-support\">fluid typography</a> lets you define font sizes that adapt for easy reading in any screen size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add starter patterns to any post type</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 6.0, site builders could add suggested patterns so that when creating a new page, you did not have to start blank. In 6.1, site builders can continue to opt-in to this feature for not only pages but for any post type. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find block themes faster</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Directory has a filter for block themes, and a pattern preview gives a better sense of what the theme might look like while exploring different themes and patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep your Site Editor settings for later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Editor settings are now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/changes-to-block-editor-preferences-in-wordpress-6-1/\">persistent for each user</a>. This means your settings will now be consistent across browsers and devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A streamlined style system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CSS rules for margin, padding, typography, colors, and borders within the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/block-styles-generation-style-engine/\">styles engine</a> are now all in one place, reducing time spent on layout-specific tasks and helps to generate semantic class names.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Updated interface options and features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Updates include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/styling-elements-in-block-themes/\">styling elements</a> like buttons, citations, and links globally; controlling hover, active, and focus states for links using theme.json (not available to control in the interface yet); and customizing outline support for blocks and elements, among other features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Continued evolution of layout options</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The default content dimensions provided by themes can now be overridden in the Styles Sidebar, giving site builders better control over full-width content. Developers have <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/updated-editor-layout-support-in-6-1-after-refactor/\">fine-grained control over these controls</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Template parts in classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/04/block-based-template-parts-in-traditional-themes/\">Block template parts can now be defined in classic themes</a> by adding the appropriate HTML files `parts` directory at the root of the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Expanded support for Query Loop blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/extending-the-query-loop-block/\">New filters</a> let Query Block variations support custom queries for more powerful variations and advanced hierarchical post types filtering options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Filters for all your styles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/filters-for-theme-json-data/\">Leverage filters</a> in the Styles sidebar to control settings at all four levels of your site—core, theme, user, or block, from less to more specific.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spacing presets for faster, consistent design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Save time and avoid hard-coding values into a theme with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/introduction-of-presets-across-padding-margin-and-block-gap/\">preset margin and padding values for multiple blocks.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Content-only editing support for container blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to content-only editing settings, layouts can be locked within container blocks. In a content-only block, its children are invisible to the List View and entirely uneditable. So you control the layout while your writers can focus on the content. Combine it with block-locking options for even more advanced control over your blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other notes of interest</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>6.1 includes a new time-to-read feature showing content authors the approximate time-to-read values for pages, posts, and custom post types.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The site tagline is empty by default in new sites but can be modified in General Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new modal design offers a background blur effect, making it easier to focus on the task at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enhancing WordPress 6.1 Accessibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is an integral part of the WordPress mission of fostering an inclusive community and supporting users of all types around the world.

more than a way to succeed online. It&#8217;s a community that has always answered his questions and helped him learn, and has enabled his voice to be heard across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are motivating benefits for Raghavendra, who has a vision impairment that introduces challenges to many of the things he wants to do. The WordPress community has helped him make some of his dreams come true. After chatting with others at WordPress events, about his wish to go trekking and running, he found he was later contacted by people in the community went with him to do just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"534\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-3.jpg?resize=534%2C748&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Raghavendra training for a marathon in 2013.\" class=\"wp-image-13702\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-3.jpg?w=534&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-3.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Raghavendra training for a marathon in 2013</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He also found WordPress events a way to raise the importance of accessibility issues, share tips, and connect local communities so they can collaborate on items both within and outside WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Life growing up with an enabling family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key asset for Raghavendra has been the support of his family as he coped with his progressive blindness. His sister took charge of teaching him important social and life skills, so he could navigate his country&#8217;s rigorous education system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those were the early days of technology everywhere, and nobody much was thinking about using it in education and day-to-day life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Raghavendra got his first computer, in 2004, it was a revelation. His sister taught him to use the internet efficiently, and he taught himself a few basics of programming. Soon he was spending 10 to 12 hours a day exploring the online world and learning about the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Discovering WordPress and blogging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2006, he learned basic web design and began to sell website templates. His growing interest in search engines and content led him to WordPress. As the years progressed, his eyesight deteriorated. He had to relearn his skills and acquire new ones to compensate. When he could no longer see the computer screen, he learnt to use screen readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point there was a gap: he had the same business skills, but he couldn&#8217;t apply them as effectively until he got comfortable with using screen readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/4.jpg?resize=800%2C534&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Raghavendra speaking at an event in Bangalore, India in 2014.

On his 23rd birthday, he had two firsts: registering a domain and publishing a blog post. At first he wrote about things happening in his daily life, which initially got low responses. But when he started attending blogging and tech meetups, he received encouragement from fellow bloggers who complimented him on his writing style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using WordPress to publish his story, Raghavendra found a love for writing and this made him want to learn and understand WordPress much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h2>“Writing freed my mind and soul from the pain and sorrow; it takes a person into a Zen state where one can understand their soul once they see their own thoughts on paper.”</h2>\n<cite>Raghavendra Satish Peri</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were still some ongoing challenges arising from his difficulties with seeing. For example, Raghavendra found coding was made more complicated. But he took it slowly, and he improved steadily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started as many WordPressers do, installing themes and plugins, and making minor changes to the code. Ultimately, he moved all of his sites to WordPress, and as he learned more about WordPress, he could help his friends and family more with their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After just a few years, Raghavendra had the skills and the confidence to build just about anything in WordPress, progressing from simple to complex websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Raghavendra is a successful entrepreneur. He sees his life as full of promise. WordPress still helps him grow every day, professionally and personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“There is always hope for tomorrow! Do not look for the light at the end of the tunnel, embrace the darkness, listen to the quietness, and feel the airflow.

As he has learnt more about the software, he felt he needed to be involved with improving accessibility too. He started to help organize local meetups and conferences and encourages others to give time and skills to contribute too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"704\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-5.jpg?resize=704%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"2016, Raghavendra on stage speaking at WordCamp Mumbai\" class=\"wp-image-13699\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-5.jpg?w=704&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-5.jpg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">2016, Raghavendra speaking at WordCamp Mumbai</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He follows software development closely, especially where WordPress meets accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, on learning about a global WordPress Accessibility event, he applied and became a speaker. His topic was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bvgLjWCRfrQ\">Gutenberg Accessibility, A Screen Reader User&#8217;s Perspective</a>. His interest continued as a result of this event, and he wanted to be part of growing its audience and impact, initially through joining its dedicated channel on Slack. Eventually, he joined the organizing team for future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping run WordPress events brought together all of Raghavendra&#8217;s existing skills. It taught him a lot about what it takes to make an event truly inclusive, from captions and sign language to media players and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As his involvement has grown, Raghavendra has found it has become easier to source and use resources that make events and presentations more accessible. But knows there&#8217;s always more that can be learnt in this area, and encourages others to use understanding from events like the Accessibility Days in their conferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global WordPress Accessibility Day 2022 online on November 2-3, 2022.&nbsp;It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\">free to register</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"568\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/wp-accessibility-day-22.png?resize=568%2C173&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress Accessibility Day 2022 logo in purple and turquoise\" class=\"wp-image-13783\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/wp-accessibility-day-22.png?w=568&amp;ssl=1 568w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/wp-accessibility-day-22.png?resize=300%2C91&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><br>Sharing learning on accessibility can be a motivator </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Raghavendra underwent his most challenging event to date, when he had a kidney transplant. To motivate himself, he started a website that focuses on accessibility and inclusive design. This prompted him to start an accessibility community to help fill the gaps in accessibility knowledge. Today, it is one of India’s largest online accessibility communities, educating developers and designers and training people with disabilities to build a career in accessibility testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?resize=680%2C790&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Portrait photo of Raghavendra post his organ transplant, 2021.\" class=\"wp-image-13698\" width=\"680\" height=\"790\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?w=774&amp;ssl=1 774w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?resize=768%2C893&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Raghavendra after his organ transplant in 2021</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Raghavendra is also a keen user of the WordPress Gutenberg editor and builds all his websites using it. Though content creation and editing can still pose him difficulties, he finds the front end of the Gutenberg blocks very accessible. He believes in participating in the software to make it a better experience for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I decided to live my life to the fullest and make my mark on the world. This thought keeps me motivated.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Raghavendra Satish Peri</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>After a successful transplant, he lives a disciplined life with a few restrictions. He continues to enjoy working in-depth in disability, accessibility, and inclusion spaces. Raghavendra hopes others will join with him and the thousands of other people who collaborate to make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Raghavendra Satish Peri (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/tarkham/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>tarkham</a>) for sharing his experiences for this latest edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>) for interviews and writing this feature, to Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>People of WordPress</em> series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

All theme authors know that theme.json isn&#8217;t quite enough for every project. However, you can benefit from those same enhancements by loading per-block stylesheets. This is also great for integrating with third-party blocks without bulking up your CSS.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index 2022&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on.

The plugin serves as a place to iterate and test new blocks, and this release introduces the new Product Query-powered Products block in beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this first iteration, users can arrange products by popular presets and control the layout in the list/grid. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The new Products block is based on the core Query Loop block.

These are patterns that don&#8217;t use WooCommerce store data but rather focus on presentation. They include the following patterns:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;WooCommerce Alternating Image and Text” block pattern. (<a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7827\">7827</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&#8220;WooCommerce Product Hero 2 Column 2 Row” block pattern. (<a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7814\">7814</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Just Arrived Full Hero”  block pattern (<a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/7812\">7812</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce Blocks contributors are also working on patterns that connect to store data and will be releasing new patterns soon.

Welcome back to Post Status Draft. This is another interview in our agency journey series where we\'re talking to agency owners and getting their backstory and their story, and sharing a little bit about their passions and the work and the world of WordPress. So today I have someone I\'ve known for a very long time, D\'nelle and I\'m gonna let her introduce herself in a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, we\'ve been, I\'ve known D\'nelle for, let\'s see. Gosh, 10 years. I\'m trying to think at least. Oh yeah. Yeah. And um, so we\'ve got to meet a couple times and I was just hearing a little bit about her story and I\'m excited for you to hear that too. So, D\'nelle, would you mind in, uh, introducing yourself and sharing, uh, what your agency is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Yeah. Um, so my name is D\'nelle Dallas. I own an agency named Berry interesting productions. We\'re very small. Um, it\'s owned by me and my husband. Um, and then we have a developer who we rely on heavily, but she is still contract with us. We primarily provide WordPress support. That\'s what we get really excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but we also build WordPress [00:01:00] websites. And depending on what the client\'s needs are, we will either say, Hey, maybe you should be on Squarespace, or, Hey, maybe you need a bigger agency. So a lot of. Is very, take a very consultative approach. And, um, yeah, so been in WordPress since 2010 now. Um, it\'s, it\'s been a, a hot minute since all of that started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and yeah, we\'ve seen a lot happen. It\'s, there\'s a lot has happened over the last 15, 17 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: No kidding. Tell me a little bit about, okay, so that\'s where you are now, and we\'re going to dive into parts of the in a minute, but tell us how you got there. So you started with WordPress in 2010?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Yeah, so I started writing HTML websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I don\'t go quite far enough back to have written, um, themes for MySpace. But that is, that\'s the kind of era that we\'re talking about is write your own HTML website era. Um, and I, so I, I came from a print background, um, [00:02:00] primarily in journalism. I thought that I was gonna go and like lay out. Uh, newspapers for a living.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had a lot of experience with type setting, a lot of experience with, um, graphic design in the sense of like user experience design. Like I kind of, um, during Covid, I, I dabbled a little bit in UX and it very much lined up with the ba like, like career background of having worked in print journalism and um, print design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then, um, in 2000 and. 10, 2011. Um, I went through career change where I was let go after a reorg and I was like, I really don\'t know what I\'m gonna do. Um, and was hired as a webmaster just because I happened to be tech savvy, was hired as a webmaster at a little company in Nashville and that company was building themselves a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I was tasked with. Basically liaising with the agency that was building this site so that I knew as much about it as possible so that I could be a good [00:03:00] webmaster for ongoing upkeep. Um, and that\'s really where I started to see the power of WordPress and what it can do for you and the ways that it can be used to do all kinds of different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and it was. After encountering WordPress that it really made sense for me to move into doing it, um, as a like long term business. Um, in 2012, I quit doing anything for anybody else and started doing this full time. Um, I\'ve definitely like kind of dabbled in other agents. Um, that was really like from a, a like supplement my own income as I built my business kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would do project management and like low level development for other agencies, um, which really has formed the way that I run. Very interesting today because you, you see that man behind the curtain, you see where. Those cracks are in the fascia and you wanna, I mean, at least I wanna fix it. Um, I didn\'t want it to be like that for the people who are working at agencies, and I don\'t want it to be like that for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so that\'s kind of how we ended up here with the [00:04:00] goal of making sure that we have clients that we are in long-term relationships with, that we can advise from a big picture perspective as opposed to just building. That\'s not what we want. Do we wanna be in the long term relationship business? Um, and so kind of as a result, we are in the website development business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it really is all about the support, all about the kind of holistic business advice from a, I was writing a blog the other day about, um, tech stacks and really like tech stacks come from the world of application building where you think about all of the languages and tools that you\'re using to build an application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like to think about that from a business perspective. There\'s a lot of like tech stack advice that I will give to clients. Like, you shouldn\'t be, you know, uh, registering your domain over here, or maybe we should think about different hosting, or you might wanna think about a different calendar booking tool that integrates with your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those kinds of things that aren\'t just about web development, but are more about the overall business operations. [00:05:00] Those are the kind of relationships that I wanna have with our clients, and that is what I wanna establish with our agency, which is a space where people are not just like coming to you saying, Hey, could you build this website for me?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they might come to you with weird questions. I wanna have the kind of relationship with our clients where we can answer those weird questions and if we can\'t answer them, we can help them find somebody that they, we know that they can trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Tell me a little bit about support. You mentioned like, okay, there\'s building this side, but there\'s this ongoing thing, and I think that\'s one of the beauties of WordPress that can do so much more for businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But could you talk about from that angle, um, the support, what it, what you\'re intending to do and what you see from some of the types of clients that you have that you do for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Um, so at the very basis of it, um, I mean I\'m kind of coming from the, uh, space where I\'m influenced by like Troy Dean and also like, let\'s not forget to mention Nathan Ingram, who is like an absolute genius in this space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, talking about like Nathan\'s scope document where he [00:06:00] talks about how you talk to clients when you are meeting them for the first time and evaluating what their needs are. Inevitably, people think they are coming to you because they wanna buy something from you. They wanna buy a product, they wanna buy this website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they don\'t understand about buying that website. And I find myself in a situation where I\'m often kind of like educating people about what it\'s like to own and use a website is that it\'s not something where you can just set it and forget it. You\'re not going to buy a car. You\'re thinking about the ongoing mainten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is going to have to happen. So I mean, we, we take a little bit of a kitchy approach with it. Very interesting productions like we are, we have this kind of like garden, like tending your garden sort of theme. That\'s really where that support comes from, is that, You can\'t just go out there and throw some seeds in the ground and then expect that you\'re gonna get the harvest that you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You really need to be paying attention to your site long term. That being said, there\'s so many things about website maintenance that really should not be on [00:07:00] mind of a business owner. Like it\'s I, I\'m kind of in a weird position because we build websites and we provide website support. So I think about this for our own website as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, you know, we serve a lot of yoga studios, a lot of wellness businesses, a lot of, um, like, you know, independent musicians. And I don\'t want, you know, the musician to be laying awake at night thinking about, is my website gonna break? Um, are, are people gonna be able to access those tour dates? Is the thing that we have set up for people to enter this raffle so that they could potentially win?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like VIP experience, is that gonna work after we put out the marketing for it? Those kinds of things. Those worries of, is this gonna work for me? Am I gonna be able to use this tool in the way that I need it when I need to? They shouldn\'t be having to think about those things. Um, you know, last year we bought a house, um, out here in Denver, Colorado.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it was the second house that we purchased, but this really is like our forever home and. Thinking about the like long term [00:08:00] things that you need to do to keep this house healthy, to keep it safe, to keep everything working properly. Like I kind of wish that I had the budget to hire somebody who would come out here and do a property walk once a month to see if my gutters are sagging or to see if there\'s something that\'s gone wrong on the roof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the kinds of things that I don\'t have the knowledge of in my own head because I\'m not spending the time thinking about it every day. So from a support perspective, We want to be that resource that is the expert on this particular niche so that you can trust us to handle it for you. And you could be thinking about, okay, what am I gonna create next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, what is my next tour gonna look like? Um, what do does the, you know, brick and mortar expansion to a second location of our yoga studio look like? It really is a situation where I want to be the trusted space that they can outsource those sorts of things so that they\'re not having to worry about them so that they\'re not spooked when somebody goes on their website and, you know, puts in a, I notice that your site\'s SEO is terrible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should contact us, you know, like through your [00:09:00] contact forum. Like I don\'t want people to be spooked by that. I want them to know that if they\'re gonna, they have a question about anything, they got a phishing email that they can call. And we\'re gonna give them that the advice that they need so that they don\'t have to like, learn a whole new set of domain knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that if they don\'t wanna deal with it that day, they can out, they can just offload it to us. That\'s, that\'s really what needs to happen. You don\'t wanna worry about looking into this like you have copyright infringement images on your site. I got that for you. I will let you know whether or not you need to pay attention to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And meanwhile, we\'re gonna make sure that your site has not actually been. So, um, it really is more about being that, that support source of support for clients, almost from an emotional perspective, more than a practical perspective. We have done the property walks around your site. We know everything is working fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one really important page that is tied to your marketing is working. There\'s nothing broken on it. You can confidently move forward with your marketing without worrying about whether or not your [00:10:00] site is gonna, you know, crack under the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: And when you go to these types of experts, you want them worrying about their craft, what they do best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the musicians for instance, like Right. You know, hey, if you\'re a fan of a big band, I want them thinking about their next song. Not necessarily worrying about, okay, what is this fishing like you said to that fishing email part. And I think that\'s the beauty of WordPress too. You can do so much with it, but as these businesses, organizations grow, they need more complexity that WordPress gives \'em.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s where I, I see you all coming in to say, we\'re gonna take this load off you so that you can focus on what you do best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: That\'s exactly right because I am so passionate just about artists in general. I mean, when I was in college, like one of my majors was creative writing. Like I definitely come from a creative space, but what I came away from college with and what has has happened during my career over the intervening years is that I find myself time and time again wanting to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People to [00:11:00] do the thing that they are really passionate about, and there are plenty of times that I have just, you know, sat head in hand being like, I do not wanna think about whether or not I should buy this new garage door or have it fixed. I don\'t wanna think about like why my water bill is so high. I just wanna hire somebody to come out here and make sure that it\'s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With their expertise. I don\'t wanna have to develop that expertise myself, and I don\'t want my clients to have to develop that expertise cuz I want \'em to spend that time creating new and amazing things that they\'re excited about. Like it\'s really hard to get excited about dns. Like really hard, like I have a hard time getting excited about dns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t want \'em to have to worry about it. If there\'s a term that they don\'t know, they don\'t know, that they don\'t understand, I want \'em to be able to come to me and me to be able to be trusted enough to give them the answer. That doesn\'t seem like I\'m coming from a place of trying to get \'em to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend more money or come from a place of trying to, you know, change the nature of our relationship in some way. Like my whole thing has always been like, I don\'t wanna hold people hostage. And I [00:12:00] really, really don\'t want artists to feel held hostage by this need to engage in something that really, like, they don\'t wanna spend their time thinking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there\'s plenty of people who are like, oh, I\'ll just DIY that website myself. Awesome. I wanna support you in DIYing it, but first let\'s have a conversation about the complexity of it so that you can make an informed decision about what you wanna learn in DIY versus what it really makes sense for you to outsource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that. You can spend the time thinking about the things that you\'re really excited about, whether that is the book that you wrote or the next tour that\'s coming up, or you know, the expansion of your studio. So it, it really is like, I mean it\'s, it\'s very much like comes from a mothering instinct in me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think. Like I\'ve got dogs, but we don\'t have kids really, like my clients and the business really take up a lot of that energy of me thinking about how can we best take care of our clients so that they are enabled to do the thing that they\'re really excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Well, you mentioned artists and I wanna talk about that part of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I [00:13:00] think it\'s so interesting working with, with artists and musicians and things like that, but, uh, that, and also the yoga and the wellness industry you talked about too, seemed like, um, we, we were talking before we started this interview, you\'re mentioning like during Covid helping some of these people that didn\'t have a lot of support infrastructure that I, I think about as like, uh, analog almost in the sense of they\'re meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People, um, in person and, uh, you know, whether it\'s a band playing a venue or it\'s a yoga instructor, and I\'d love to you to share a little bit about that, that work with those types that I think Covid, uh, helped, uh, open an opportunity, I think for a lot of businesses like. To kind of go, okay, now we can use leverage web and online to build and grow our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Well, I mean, for a lot of people it really was a smack in the face. I mean, if you think about yoga studios, that is a very in person [00:14:00] thing. I mean, we definitely have like online classes that we can take, but I mean, if you\'re anything like me, like it is not the same. And it\'s, it\'s the same for like, um, for musician.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, my, my favorite story that I like to tell about Vibe is that in October of 2020, uh, we went to a show in South Central Tennessee. It\'s a place called The Caverns in Pelham, Tennessee. And they normally have bluegrass underground in their caverns, but because everything was, we can only do outdoor. Um, they set up a stage above their caverns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They like brought in a stage and we, our favorite artist was playing a show on this stage. And we were like, partially it was a personal thing, like, we have got to get out of this house and, and do something, or we\'re gonna absolutely drive each other mad. And the other part of it, especially for me, was a deep curiosity about how they were gonna pull this off, because it really was, I mean, you know, to use a very tired word, it was unprecedented for all of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] So what is this gonna look like with all of these new restrictions and all of these unknowns? And so we went down to the caverns and I was incredibly impressed with the operations of how they had turned this thing that they normally have, like in a, in a enclosed space. Into doing this outdoors. Um, which I think that they\'ve continued to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They definitely had more shows outdoors after this first one. But the notable thing about this show was that we are sitting in like our little six foot square and they have, they\'re using an app that you can order, um, concessions off of that\'ll be delivered. And it was all very interesting. And then the show started and the vibe of everyone in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that audience was so subdued, it was unnerving to watch the way that we had all clearly been affected by being in our houses for six, seven months at that point. And I think about that a lot in terms of these in person things. That in person is incredibly important and we\'re never, [00:16:00] I don\'t think we are ever really going to be able to replicate that in an online, in a virtual environment, but a lot of us were forced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the people that was forced to do that was a, um, client of ours, um, named no Novo Fitness studio. They\'re out of Midland, Georgia. We absolutely adore them. They are like, they\'re just our favorite to work with. Like they really get our vibe. We really get their vibe. And we\'re in a position where the yoga studio owners, it\'s a two sisters, they don\'t have to think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their website because they know that they can come to us and be like, Hey, we wanna do this, can you make it happen? And we can give them good advice about whether or not they should make it happen. And so with them, what we did is, this was very early on, I think this like started in April of 2020. They are like, we are absolutely bleeding money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are paying. Rent on a brick and mortar that we can\'t use. Like the sisters would go in there and like do yoga in the studio themselves, but you can\'t have other people coming in, right? [00:17:00] Like it\'s, this is, we\'re all in lockdown. What do we do to maintain the, the vibe of the community that we have built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, whether that is. A music, like a touring musician or whether that is, uh, a yoga studio or an acupuncturist or any kind of like wellness. Any, any of the people who are kind of in the, the verticals that we tend to work in. Um, how can we retain the magic that is that in person stuff while we are all stuck inside?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so with Novo, what we did is we built them like a little OnDemand, uh, video portal. So it\'s got gated content. The content is served up through Vimeo, but you can only access it if you\'re logged into their website. It was a relatively simple thing. We hadn\'t built anything like that before, but we had used all of these tools before the, um, the content gate tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'d used Vimeo before. Um, and really like we were all stuck inside. Nobody really knew what to do, so we built this really quickly. I mean, it definitely, I think there\'s a case study out on. About the, [00:18:00] the process of it. It was definitely daunting because this was completely new for them and they weren\'t really sure how they wanted to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they ended up with is a thing that\'s gonna do two things for them. First, it helped them keep a revenue stream going. Which was really, really important. But that, like during Covid, but that turned into an additional revenue stream now that we are all back in person and they are, you know, having their five, six classes a day in their brick and mortar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so having that additional kind of passive revenue stream, really, you upload one video and it\'s. Going to serve up, you know, infinite number of times for infinite number of people. Um, you know, I think about that a lot with my business. What is recurring revenue? Like, how does that help us to be able to make long-term decisions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They now have a line item in their budget that is recurring revenue in a way that is almost passive, that\'s not dependent upon being present in the real world. But the thing is, is I don\'t think that that really is the end of it. I think that now we\'ve got this on demand. [00:19:00] Tool that they can use as a revenue booster, but it is helping them to maintain that those in person relationships, like they\'ve got one person who, um, right prior to c she and her, she had moved to Italy because of her partner\'s job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so she wasn\'t able to come into these yoga classes anymore. And when she found out that Novo was offering on demand video, she was like, please, can you figure out a way that I can. Um, get to these videos because I miss attending these classes. I miss these instructors. I miss the community of the people that I was with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at this point, that\'s what I wanna see out of virtual. I wanna see virtual providing this kind of like steam release valve. Like there is no telling what\'s gonna come our way, is another pandemic gonna come our way? Like, who knows what\'s happening? Like right now with like, I think I read something the other day about like avian flu making things like really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like difficult for, uh, the, the poultry industry. Like there\'s just all of these variables that we don\'t know what\'s gonna come at us, but if we [00:20:00] have a really strong virtual presence that\'s supporting our in-person presence, it\'s gonna make us more resilient all around. If you know one of the artists that we\'re working with right now, Has the flu and if she were not feeling as bad as she is, the conversation that we would be having right now is, okay, well I can\'t go do this show this weekend, but I still want to connect with the people who are gonna be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still wanna make sure that they\'re gonna have an amazing. Friday night. What does that look like from a digital perspective? Do we have the infrastructure on our site to have this membership portal set up so that we can gate this content and make sure that we\'re still capturing that revenue so that we can keep doing what we\'re doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Like that really is what I want. I want our yoga studios. I want our artists to be able to keep doing the work that they\'re really, really passionate about, and if they have a digital infrastructure, Stable. They\'re gonna be able to rely on that to be able to create a, a more holistic approach to, well, I, I can\'t go out this weekend for whatever reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m tested positive for Covid, but I feel [00:21:00] fine. I\'d love to do something this weekend. Okay, well we can move into digital for that. But primarily we are still invested in being in the real world. Um, which is honestly, like Covid taught me that, like, I don\'t think I really appreciated the value of those real world connections and being in the same room as people until you weren\'t allowed to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Well, I, I think you\'ve really illustrated great, uh, case study too, which is having a backup when you\'re in person, whatever that is, and you just can\'t happen. But also I think you\'re showcasing too, where they can use that, not just in those bad times, but good times to continue to grow and support their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like when you talked about the Exactly. The yoga fitness studio, um, it\'s an extension. They record those videos once. And then they get to share that with whoever they want in their, uh, in their business. Uh, and it\'s up there. That\'s the beauty of the web. That\'s 24 7, 365, especially if they\'re supported by [00:22:00] very interesting productions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like, you know, to extend the service and things that you do. Websites, web\'s always been, I love this because you can do so much more with little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Exactly, exactly like these, the, the yoga studio like Nova, uh, fitness is not focused on their website, and I don\'t want them to be focused on their website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want them to focus on the real world, brick and mortar, making the vibe in that yoga studio exactly what their community needs. I don\'t want them to be thinking about like, oh, well, I need to go do this on my website now. No, no, no. You\'ve got somebody who\'s gonna handle that for you. They\'re gonna take care of it, and they\'re gonna provide you with the advice that you need about whether you should be doing it or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there\'s a lot of people who I\'m like, no, I, I really don\'t think you wanna like, Spend part of your budget on that. Um, we have that conversation when it comes to design a lot that the, the level of client that we work with doesn\'t necessarily need custom design. What they need is [00:23:00] graphic design support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And use existing design templates or, you know, like we, we really love to work with Divvy a lot, and Divvy has a really great library of, um, page templates and like kind of starter designs that really serve our clients. But I don\'t want them to be spending their time and their money on something that they could otherwise have turned to really growing their business and cultivating the, the, what they\'re really passionate about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which, you know, for Novo it\'s really about being in person and. You know, cultivating that community that they have built up. I mean, that was the scary part of Covid, is you think I have spent all of this time building up this community of people who are willing to get out of their houses to come see me every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what is going to happen now? Everybody\'s gonna be out of the habit of it. And are people gonna also forget about me? Um, I don\'t want, I, I. To be able to create the kind of stability that like helps businesses thrive. And so having this in an [00:24:00] emergency is great, but also having it as a part of the overall plan for growing your business is really huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I mean, if they had already had on demanded place, they could have spent their time in their money marketing that on demand to people who are not. Already their students. Um, so I, I want our clients to be able to make really smart decisions and decisions that are gonna keep their business as stable as possible, even in the face of something like Covid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Well, you, you very much, you know what I\'ve heard resonates with me because you\'ve talked about a web presence can be a chore. Or the two words you used were, uh, cultivating community. So using it as a channel to reach your customers, reach your prospective customers, and build and cultivate that community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the musician we were talking about is like, right, she can\'t be there Friday night, but her website can be there in some shape, manner, or form to help cultivate that interest in community. Right. [00:25:00] Um, Okay. So the last question I want to ask, uh, is tips for people starting out as an agency wanting to do, uh, use WordPress as a, as a tool to build, uh, and, and, uh, client websites and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What, what advice would you give looking back as you\'ve shared your story? I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: I wish that I had listened harder and more intently to the things that Nathan Ingram was saying from the very beginning. Um, you know, it took me a really long time to build up, um, not necessarily automated processes, but processes that I\'m really comfortable with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, whether that is the task management system that we are using or the way that we onboard clients, what those discovery calls look like, what our road mappings look like, kind of vetting those clients to see what the relationship between us and that client is like. I wish that I had, I could like just magically go back in time and tell [00:26:00] myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on those relationships with your clients because that\'s what\'s gonna feel the best for you. So anybody that\'s starting out, I mean, first of all, like just meet as many people as you possibly can. I feel like Covid has kind of done that for like the kids that are graduating college right now. I\'ve had some really cool conversations with kids that are like, I am graduating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know how to get into this industry. What do I do? My answer is always meet and talk to as many people as you possibly can who are already doing the kind of thing that you wanna do or that you think you wanna do. Like you may think that you wanna build websites, but you get five years down the road and you realize what your talent actually is, is project management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I\'m calling myself out on that. Like I am first and foremost a project or a production manager. I am super good at that. It, my brain works that way. I really should not have my hands deeply in code because it takes me longer to do that than it would somebody who is really focused on that. So the more people that you can meet [00:27:00] to find out what it is that they do, what is their day like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what do they get really excited about when it comes to the work that they do is gonna help you identify the best. For you and I mean if it, if you are, are like already hell bent on starting your own agency. The advice there is, is kind of the same, get to know people as much as possible. I mean, I, there was a a point in 2015 where I made a, well 2016, where I made a huge mistake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hired a couple people who I thought that I had a good relationship with. And it went very south very quickly. I think it ended up costing me a little under $20,000 when it all came down to it. I mean, I was really lucky that I had the ability to be financially resilient in that way and we\'re still here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but. The relationships that you\'re gonna build with clients and the relationships that you\'re gonna build with other people in the community are what are going to support you and help you be resilient. I could not be as resilient I as I am if it [00:28:00] weren\'t for the people at Ithe who are providing part of the engine to run my business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people in the post status community who, if I need a specific type of developer, I can go out there and it\'s like shooting fish in a barrel. You can. Five people who are gonna be the exact person that you need to do this work for your client. The relationships that we have are above all the thing that are sustaining us and helping us be resilient, and I did not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I couldn\'t really wrap my head around that until probably five years into doing my, into doing my business. I mean, I grew up in a situation where it was very much like, shut your work is the proof of the actual, like work product is the proof of whether you\'re good or not, and. As I moved through kind of owning my own thing, it became obvious that there\'s a lot of people out there who are doing really, really quality work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is more about how you resonate with the people who you are working with and, and the maintenance. And the cultivation of those [00:29:00] relationships that is going to provide you with the stability you need to build whatever it is you\'re wanting to build. Whether that is a web development agency or a a, you know, content marketing business, or, you know, if you wanna start a yoga studio, think about the people who you have in your network who are gonna be able to support you in that, and how much do you trust them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it takes time to build up trust. It takes experimentation. It. You know, a lot of, um, hit a lot of, you know, mishits really, you know, just like the people that I hired in 2016 who it didn\'t work out. I mean, there are definitely like plenty of situations I found myself in where I didn\'t do all of the work I needed to do to really establish that Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kind of trust. I mean, and I take responsibility for that too. Like I really dove into that relationship in a very naive way. Um, whereas I think that if it happened to me now, I don\'t think I would\'ve ended up in a situation that was as scary as that was for me, a sort of. Gigantic fail that it took me a couple months to recover from emotionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, just because I went into it thinking [00:30:00] more about the work than I was about the relationships, which is why I focus so hard on relationships now because that really is where the best stuff is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: I love your energy and your approach. It really resonates with me relationship. So key. When you really get that aligned, you\'re, you\'re doing your best work, you\'re helping someone else, getting rewarded for it, and um, it makes everything better, doesn\'t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: It really, really does. I mean, that is why I\'m focused on support instead of website development. Like it\'s almost like you go anywhere and get anybody to build a website for you. Like you can hop out on Upwork or you can outsource it to a team in India. But the long relationship provides so many dividends over the years of knowing that person\'s business of understanding really where they are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we have one client right now. Her mother just passed away. She needs some time. That changes the project. The, like, the, the arc of our project build. It [00:31:00] changes, you know, the, when I\'m gonna need to bring in a, um, a developer for something versus when I\'m gonna need to bring in the SEO specialist. It changes a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But having known this client now since 2012, I know what I\'m gonna be able to expect from her, what she\'s gonna be capable of. And she knows that in a situation where she\'s kind of like in a personal crisis, she knows that she can offload and delegate more work to us that is gonna make it possible for her to do what she needs to do for herself personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those are the kind of relationships that I want to. I wanna be in a situation where somebody knows that they can call me up and say, Hey, I\'m gonna need more help this month. In the same fashion that they can call me up and be like, Hey, I\'ve gotta go with this other agency for X, Y, Z. Can you help me offboard myself from you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t ever want people to felt, feel like they\'re held hostage. I want people to feel like if they need a hand, they\'re handheld, that we are right here to grab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Hostage to an ally you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Pardon me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Exactly. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: Well, Daniel, thank you so [00:32:00] much for sharing your story and also your passion and what you\'re doing in WordPress for your clients and making a difference in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, tell us where we can find more about you and, and your work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D’nelle Dowis: Um, so if you are interested in primarily the digital side of our business, we do have some in-person stuff that we do with live events, um, that we are, uh, kind of weaving in and out. But um, for the website support, go to web dot berry interesting.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I did the other day just get the domain that doesn\'t have the hyphen in it, and I\'m all excited, but, Switched over yet. Um, so yeah, web dot barry interesting.com and all of the information is out there. Um, we also have kind of upped our presence on social media. Um, I\'m doing a lot more on LinkedIn than I used to do, um, and we\'re pushing a bunch more content out to our business, LinkedIn as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but all of those links are out on our website. And, um, if you wanna find me anywhere on social media, um, I\'m primarily on Instagram. D underscore, n e l l e. [00:33:00] Um, I post a lot of dog photos and, uh, and stuff from when I am actually traveling. So it\'s that, that is not really, uh, professionally focused, but it\'s fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I, I really appreciate it. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk to me today.

Um, we\'re doing a new series called The Product People, basically where we\'re talking to the people actually driving the product at all these great companies. And one of our first to do this is Robert, my friend Robert Jacobi. Who leads WordPress endeavors over there, and I\'ll let him actually share in just a second what he actually does in his actual title or Robert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\'ve known Robert for a couple years now and hearing some of his backstory, I\'m excited for this because. I mean, he\'s had a wealth of experience, not just in WordPress, but before that other communities and agency work. And so, um, today, the purpose of this, the intention of these interviews is really to say there\'s all these cool products out there in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let\'s talk to the people driving the vision, um, the roadmaps, the work that gets done for the people buying those products. So I wanna give, like, I, I personally, Robert, like [00:01:00] the human angle. I don\'t like to just buy from a button. I wanna buy from a human, ultimately know there\'s people out there. I give the example a lot of like Tom bin bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now Tom has actually exited that business. But I was like, you get to hear the story. You get to hear him, his background and talk about how you designed this particular backpack. But, uh, anyway, Robert, thanks for coming on to the draft podcast, talking about, uh, the product and what you\'re doing at Cloud Ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But would you give us a set, uh, little background about yourself, how you got into it, what you, well, let\'s say, let\'s start with what you actually do at Cloud Ways, what you\'re responsible for, and then I\'ll ask how you got there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Okay. So we\'ll, we\'ll, we\'ll, Teased it out backwards. Fantastic. Yeah. Thanks so much for, for having me here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Corey, I, you know, I, I love post status, love you and your family. Uh, really thrilled to be here. Uh, so I, my title, which titles don\'t mean Anything, but, uh, as director of WordPress at Cloud Ways, uh, it\'s a fancy way of saying [00:02:00] strategy partnerships, product marketing, c. So all the above. All the above. And probably things I\'m missing, and those</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> that know you well, know that it\'s very fitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the things were in one hat and director of WordPress. I love it. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> But, uh, yeah, it\'s, I, I guess I could say it\'s been like a 20 year journey to get here. I\'ve been at, uh, cloud Ways for about a year and a half actually just. But started, uh, in open source decades ago. Boy, that makes it sound so long. . Years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just, just years ago. And, uh, uh, built an agency around initially Java, but then actually jula, uh, the content management system and focused on that aspect of implementing backend work with Jum. Open source, connecting up to all that fun open source [00:03:00] stuff, which actually led me to being a leader of the project, uh, for a little bit in the late 20 teen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That\'s the part that I, I really appreciate. One of the many things about your story is like you were in, in this very big community called Joomla. And I, I\'ve told you my story, it was in 2006 when we were retailing our organization\'s website. I was working at, at the time, and one of the developers, uh, mentioned Joomla and Joomla, still around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jim was still. And I think still with the open web conversation serves a vital interest, but you really were like in that inner circle of community helping lead and drive that project for a long time. And I know I bounce things off you over time because now we have this WordPress thing, and I know Drupla was even set up differently too from a governance standpoint and getting your feedback and the pros and cons and strengths and weaknesses of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that say, I, I still am a cheerleader for Jula cuz I think it works in a lot of, [00:04:00] for a lot of people in a lot of settings. But I think there\'s lessons that you have from that experience that, that I know. I\'ve appreciated hearing your thoughts on WordPress specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Oh my gosh. Well, we don\'t have 17 hours to go over that, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, exactly that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'ll say that one for another one. Yeah. But three</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> very differently run organizations. Each successful in the way they wanna be successful. So that\'s what actually makes it interesting that the way you run an organization can define, helps you define what success is and then you can actually focus on it more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> the other part of the background for you too is running your own agency. So like you, when you\'re building product there, I love highlighting this because you\'re, you were, The user for a lot of companies, including cloudy product stuff that I think is really, uh, helps you build a more intuitive product too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I know from years running your own agency, like you come in from the gr, you know, from the people doing the work out there, that always [00:05:00] don\'t get showcased as well. And WordPress and Post has specifically, but I think that\'s another angle is like you\'ve been there, you\'ve earned your straps as an</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> agency owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. And I just, whenever I think that far back, I think of when we had our servers in a closet, you know, hosting customers, you know, way back then. Yeah. Oh wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Now you\'re, now you\'re dating yourself .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> No, I don\'t miss that .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So, uh, then fast forward, okay, so there was this time where I know you stepped into the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was before cloud. Can you share a little bit about that and why you chose to step into the WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> community? Sure. After I kind of, uh, rolled out of the agency, I started looking for just something new to do, for lack of a better term or phrase, and, uh, uh, joined the executive team at Perfect Dashboard, which is, uh, which was a company that built a automatic [00:06:00] update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tool for WordPress, uh, that was acquired by WP Engine at the beginning of 2019. And then I just focused on, uh, in a lot of ways helping the open source community understand what businesses needed, but even more importantly, for businesses to let them know how open source communi. Work and, and it\'s not just about, you can throw, you know, millions of dollars at something and everyone\'s gonna love you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s a lot of, you know, get to know the people, get engaged, uh, be a part of everything from a word camp, you know, to a jula day, to, you know, whatever the open source project is. But you know, you, you need to have skin in the game to be taken seriously by a lot of people who have spent hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of hours within those open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I\'m</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> thankful you, you took the step into the WordPress community and then so fast forward, you got the [00:07:00] gig at Cloud Ways. You all have had a lot of, um, new things coming out from a product standpoint and then also new news coming out from a company standpoint and that you were acquired by Digital Ocean or, um, let\'s see, August, September, I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> wanna say, uh, the beginning of September was, uh, yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we closed there. It\'s been, uh, 2022. Uh, so it\'s technically our 10 year anniversary. And, uh, I unfortunately we\'ve had like no time to celebrate it. It\'s been busy as can be. You know, the, the, the opening up of the world post, you know, post covid, uh, you know, depending how you look at it. So, lots of travel, lots of events, a lot of, you know, Meeting folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, uh, partnership with CloudFlare. We announced, uh, safe updates. Uh, so, and then of course the digital ocean acquisition. So we\'ve been, it\'s this, this one year\'s we feel like we\'ve done, uh, 10 years of work in one year for our 10th anniversary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That\'s how it goes. That was similar. Similar to mine with iThemes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had just celebrated our [00:08:00] 10th anniversary and we were required. Um, okay. So let\'s talk about WordPress as it relates to cloud ways. So this is what you lead that particular product. Tell us about the product at Cloud Way specific to</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> WordPress. So, uh, we actually have a number of WordPress products, I guess to put it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of Cloud Ways is to just, it\'s a managed cloud, you know, hosting solution and, you know, we can all blah, blah, blah about manage hosting. Um, and I will, don\'t worry. But, uh, you know, one of the things we, we focused on was just making it, you know, One click easy. So we, we really want to, uh, enable folks, you know, who have one 10, you know, hundred sites to just be able to get on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, either start from scratch with, you know, sort of a, a more, you know, cloud ways, uh, adapted version. WordPress. It\'s totally WordPress. We just make sure that, you know, caching and things are turned on the way you might want it. [00:09:00] Um, or, you know, or just sort of. Naked WordPress. So nothing\'s tweaked at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, WooCommerce of course. And then, you know, we, we have some bundles around, uh, other packages and products. Just make it, again, one click easy. Uh, lots of folks can do one click easy. WordPress, what, you know, we focused on the whole time is how do you get that WordPress Cloud site cloud enabled? And, uh, you know, yes, you can go to a shared hosting site and say, I want a WordPress install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\'s a lot more work behind the scenes. You know, we want our users to feel like, yes, it\'s just the same thing, but behind the scenes you\'re on a very scalable, uh, high performance, secure infrastructure. So when</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> someone\'s looking at their building, building a website or launching a project, and they go, Hey, I want the scale of cloud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the easiness, not having to kind of go through and tinker with settings and things like that from a, and you know me, I\'m not very technical, but [00:10:00] from the cloud is awesome in this dream, in that you can scale and do all these kinds of things, but there\'s work in between that needs to happen to help get it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress ready. Is that where kind of cloud waste kind of comes in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Without a doubt. I mean, if you go to any of \'em, so obviously we\'re now owned by digital lotion, but you know, digital lotion, aws, gcp, so that\'s Google Cloud, uhlin, node, vulture, you know, all these platforms are much more tech focused. So you can do a lot of really cool stuff on any of these platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like really dive data, dive, uh, Deep in, uh, you get root, you can do, you know, all kinds of crazy tech voodoo and you have fantastic platforms and applications out there on that. But boy, if you just want to get WordPress going, that is a pain in the rear. Uh mm-hmm. , you know, we used to work with AWS and Azure back in the agency days, and [00:11:00] Oh man, just to get stuff going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you need that certification or, or you\'re going to misconfigure something or even worse, you\'re gonna misbuild the Jesus outta yourself and what you thought was gonna be a, you know, a $50, you know, bill for the month. All of a sudden it\'s like 500 or a thousand dollars because you left something on that you weren\'t supposed to, and you didn\'t know that it was gonna be metered and build out in such and such a way, or some database process went crazier, haywire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, We try to get rid of that risk at Cloud ways and just mitigate that so you can be like, oh, I am on Digital Ocean and I don\'t need to worry about any of this stuff. I\'m paying a monthly fee. I\'m not gonna get surprised with anything. Uh, really just kind of making it what, you know, a lot of shared hosting used to be back in the day, but without all the performance bottlenecks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. You mentioned cloud. Is 10 years old and so I like been around for a long time. And I know this predates you [00:12:00] at the company, but like when did the WordPress specific offering start to come into the cloud? Ways history and product climate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> We started out as actually a Magento shop. That was our first big offering, uh, that was sort of cloud enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we, uh, look at it, I think with the n memory serves, About three years, two to three years, we, uh, had on, you know, put together our WordPress packages to be able to deploy across, uh, cloud providers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. So when you think about the product, um, that we, we talked about this big problem, you know, and I love your phrase there, cloud enabled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so who do you find in your customer community that you know just goes, okay, this. This is exactly what we need for what we\'re doing. Are there some common kind of avatars and customer journeys you see most often?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Uh, first and foremost, our best customers are agencies, uh, because it\'s really easy to manage, [00:13:00] uh, you know, the costs of having a ton of clients on your infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, the flexibility is yes, I can have a digital ocean droplet. A hundred sites, if they\'re all, you know, small, simple brochure sites and you know, that\'s costing you $10 a month, plus or minus, I can\'t remember the exact, maybe it\'s 10 99 . Mm-hmm. , you know, a. To host as many, you know, as many sites as that droplet can handle, or you can scale that heck out of it and have, you know, a super e-commerce site that\'s, you know, got 300 plus concurrent users and chugging away, uh, on its own droplets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You, you can mix and match, you know, across the platform. Uh, not even just with one cloud provider, but across multiple providers. Cause some folks do have that. AWS expert in a house or as a contractor, and they do wanna tweak some things, uh, to the best of their ability. Again, it\'s managed so we don\'t let them blow up everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, [00:14:00] uh, we, we have, uh, use cases where, you know, there\'s front end stuff that\'s, you know, quickly being handled by, uh, digital ocean. And then there\'s like some crazy backend batch processing that\'s happening on a, you know, super high performant, you know, aws, uh, EC two. So like diversity</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> of the projects within an agency, like you said, brochure wear all the way to something that skills bigger in one place where you can kind of manage all those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that\'s pretty</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> compelling. Uh, I wish I would\'ve had that 20 years ago. , right, right. Building up a staging and deployment server and a production server and yeah. All that fun. And managing</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> all that cloud complexity too. Uh, for sure. So what are some of the, um, examples, like you mentioned eCommerce, um, and I know WooCommerce is something that a lot of your customers do and use the platform for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, can you give us some more like, niche down examples too, of, it doesn\'t have to be by name [00:15:00] of course, but like what you\'re seeing in the community at cloud ways, you know, you\'ve got is WooCommerce, something that comes up quite a bit is obviously WordPress too, but what are some of. Uh, niche down, you know, journeys that you see</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> in the community too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it\'s e-commerce across the board. So, uh, just jump back slightly on the sort of the audiences we have at, at Cloud Wastes. Yeah. Uh, we focus on SMBs. I mean, that, that, that is, you know, the crux of our mission, the crux of our joy. Uh, our, our model\'s always been moving dreams forward, but it\'s also, you know, how do we accelerate?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opportunity for our customers. And it, it, it\'s almost easiest to see in the SMB space cause you can do a few little things and, uh, performance increases, uh, trust increases. Uh, our customers, customers are happy. And that, that kind of is a, a flywheel of, of, I wanna say a flywheel of joy. Patent pending, um, , [00:16:00] uh, but that, but a lot of it\'s on the e-commerce side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Pretty much every site on the web these days has some kind of e-commerce component, however you wanna monetize it, whether that\'s through ad traffic or actually running a store. Uh, we focus a lot on WooCommerce because it\'s a, uh, a great platform. It\'s an open source e-commerce platform. Um, it\'s hard to name many of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, it, it, it, there\'s a lot of flexibility with what you can do with it. And so, People wanna spin up a shop. Uh, no, we\'re not Shopify, you\'re not gonna be able to just start dragging, dropping. But when you\'re looking at, you know, do I wanna be locked into, uh, a system where, you know, I don\'t have all the control that I need?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my site that I, you know, I might be locked in on data. I might not be able to, uh, move or migrate or all that kind of stuff. We, you know, we certainly believe that W Commerce is the way to go. Uh, we [00:17:00] just, uh, had a, you know, w Commerce speed challenge. Uh, you know, we like to engage with the W Commerce community, with other users of Glu commerce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, you know, it. I\'ve always loved open source. It\'s, it\'s the, the communities, uh, drive satisfaction, which makes it exciting to, uh, evolve with customers. And because it\'s open source, you can do a lot of stuff to, you know, quickly, uh, take in that feedback. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> drilling down to the products, the offerings that you have too, what are some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we, we could just say it as what are the kind of features, the core parts of the products that you\'re really most proud of, and that you see people really like maxing out to the, uh, to the, to the furthest they can with, with the actual products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> I love having staging that\'s always there and one click ready</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\'s, that\'s great. It should be everywhere. Um, you know, [00:18:00] we get you going with that right away. Uh, you know, one click to be able to migrate across cloud platforms, I think is, is amazing. I don\'t know where else you can just sit there and go, oh, you know, uh, I don\'t need Google anymore. You know, I just, I just wanna put this over on digital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, you can do that and you can go back and forth all day long. Um, that it\'s a, it\'s a unique, uh, for me cool factor to be able to take advantage of, uh, you know, how different platforms run and the, you know, the value some, you know, are obviously gonna cost more and maybe there\'s value, maybe there\'s, you know, you have the value, you don\'t need that, uh, type of, uh, expense performance, so you can easily ratchet down as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, you know, that\'s cool. Uh, you know, a lot. Good things around, uh, optimizing and securing WordPress from, you know, how we implement CloudFlare, how, how, you know, how our safe updates work. Um, which is sort of that very similar to what I did back in [00:19:00] the perfect dashboard days. Um, automatic WordPress and plugin updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, getting those basics in line is critical. So I really like that those work and, you know, You don\'t wanna worry about that as a customer, you know, you wanna worry about the cool stuff or, you know, what\'s my next product gonna be? You know, or you know, how am I gonna launch a, you know, a Black Friday Cyber Monday campaign?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t wanna be worried about, you know, is my site gonna get jammed up? Is it gonna get a hacked, is it, you know, gonna just flub around. Yeah, went</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> back to the one click across the platforms that, that\'s a, seems like a compelling feature specifically for agencies who go, okay, I\'m not getting what I want here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And being able to click do a one click migration. That\'s outstanding. It, it\'s, it\'s,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> it\'s really cool. It\'s, it\'s like, you know, that value proposition got me hook, line, and sinker when, uh, I first started working at cloud. Yeah, I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> remember, uh, we had, [00:20:00] uh, an aws, you know, part of our SaaS solution at Ithe, and that built, you know, initially the processing really awesome until you do it on scale and then you\'re like, just that, being able to move the, uh, and migrate to different, you know, cloud solutions I think would be great from a price standpoint, if anything, but I\'m sure there\'s other compelling reasons to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you\'re not the right solution, isn\'t there? But do you see other, do you see com, you know, other paths why people would go, okay, I\'m gonna use this one clip to go over here. Do you see that quite a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> bit too? Uh, a lot of times just the needs have changed. So it\'s, you know, either I need to ramp up, uh, what I have at Digital Ocean or, you know, or ramp down from, uh, something that I thought was, that started off strong, but you know, It\'s going, but we really just don\'t need that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we don\'t need, uh, whatever GCP may be offering and then, you know, ramp it down to, you know, maybe a high end [00:21:00] digital ocean server, but you\'re still save droplet, I should say. Um, but you\'re still saving 50%, uh, for what you were paying before. And, you know, we\'ve, we keep a, a big guy on. The value propositions, especially in our fund, ever-changing, uh, economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, we\'re seeing a lot of people take the time to evaluate what they, you know, have provision for themselves, whether that\'s at Cloud ways or another provider and, and, and, you know, spend a week or two doing the math and being like, you know what, we can get the same kind of performance, you know, at cloud ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhere else, but you know, people are actually finally looking at, you know, those infrastructure costs I think a little bit more seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. And when you said the needs part, I thought it seems like a graduation. Okay, this served me for this season of time, for whatever I\'m doing now. I\'m graduating to a different, different offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then even though Cloud Wises is owned by Digital Ocean, I know you have all those. [00:22:00] Yeah. And um, I\'ve heard the plan is to continue to, to have those options so that. Being able to pick where you\'re at with that kind of ease is a lot, a lot in the hosting. Now I go way back here, but like in the, the problem with hosting was typically you can\'t move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s hard to move, it\'s easy to get in, hard to get out. And so now with that, that those options out there you can graduate on when you have</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> needs change. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we support digital Ocean Lin, node Vulture, gcp, and aws, and, uh, you know, yes, you\'re on top of clouds doing that, but of course, we\'re all, we\'re launching open source applications, so yes, you could even move off of clouds very easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, that\'s, that, that kind of, I think the, that idea of hosted lock in is it\'s never gonna leave because you can make a lot of money if you get the right, you know, Bit of traction initially. I mean, obviously you can look at, you know, the wickes of the world, but I, I think people are only satisfied for [00:23:00] so long with that until they realize that there are, there are a lot of stumbling blocks, uh, to doing what you want and having, you know, flexibility, freedom, scalability are, are, are much more important than, Just being able to do a little bit of drag and drop, and frankly, I\'m gonna keep rolling on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source keeps improving. And, you know, I don\'t want those guys to disappear because, you know, it\'s great to keep, you know, open source projects on their toes. Like, you know, they\'re, they\'re finding niches in the market which are, are critical, important, and relevant, and, and users are going to them. So I think that\'s a great challenge for open source projects to, you know, evaluate what\'s going on there and being like, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s something we should add in. We should add in blocks, for example, and we can have a block editor and we can have, oh my gosh, they just changed. Name. What\'s FSC being called now? Just site editor. It\'s not site editor. Site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, so we, we\'ve been talking about some of the product [00:24:00] solutions in particular, like the one click staging. Um, anything else before I ask about, you know, how you\'re seeing users in your community make the most of it, what the ones are going? Okay. They\'re, they\'re, they\'re taking the most advantage of what we designed this for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anything else before we get to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Uh, I think folks should, I, I touched on just a mo a moment ago. Uh, take a look at your infrastructure, see what you\'re paying for, see if that\'s providing the value. Uh, you know, and cloud ways may not be the right fit and that\'s okay. Um, because if there is a right fit somewhere else, you should always go with the right fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, uh, take the time and I think this year especially is a good time to you. Just kind of go through that, you know, are, are you really getting the value out of you know, what you\'re paying for and maybe you\'re paying too little and getting too little and not even realizing it because you haven\'t done the homework of maybe running a couple of speed tests and realizing that, wow, my site actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Takes five plus seconds to load. It\'s just really fast. Cause it\'s always cashed on my own [00:25:00] browser cause I\'m checking it every morning. So , you know, little things like that can make a huge difference in, you know, in seo, in sales, uh, and, and just friendliness, uh, for web visitors. People don\'t, people just are impatient on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like that. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> the two themes I\'m hearing is value, being able to assess, hey, is this the right solution? Are we getting the right value? Are we spending too much? Whatever that is. And the other side of it, which is need, okay, are we getting what we need from that platform? We\'d rather, Hey, we\'ve been looking at this different option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those are two that kind of funnel into what you built. You all build it cloud waste. Yep. Awesome. Okay. All right. So. Now let\'s how to use the most, how to get the most out of the product that you all have built at Cloud Wastes. So what are the ways you see in the community or the ways you even think from the product perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re like, I just wish people would do this, this, and that, or whatever that is. Um, you, I built products for a long time, or at [00:26:00] least led product teams that both work and you\'re always. We built that. So you would do this, but they miss it or, gosh, we, we spend our, you know, for us it was like we spend every day thinking about the product and the, or the problem and the solution, and then people get it and you\'re like, they\'re using like 5% of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What sticks out in your mind from that standpoint? People that are really using it for all it\'s worth or the, or also the ones that go, oh, I wish they\'d just do these two things, or whatever that is. Uh, in terms of making, making the most of what you\'ve, you and your team have built?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> So for the, for the technically and kind companies, I really wish they would use our API more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, we have an agency partner that. Very geeky on the inside. So it was great. They, they, they jumped on the cloud ways and they said, oh, you guys have this api? We\'re like, yeah. And they\'re, well, can we do X, Y, and Z with it? [00:27:00] We\'re like, yes. So they are literally, uh, they\'ve created their whole, you know, to mention a competitor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve created their own like Pantheon esque. Instance of cloud ways. So the, all their deployments, uh, whether it\'s for existing projects or new projects from staging, from dev to staging, uh, production, it\'s all done with, you know, scripts, you know, on their, on their side of the universe, and they can, you know, Do very complicated, uh, integrations of, uh, new code and whatnot, you know, across their stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s all on cloud ways, on, you know, a bunch of droplets. And it\'s brilliant. It\'s, it\'s actually my favorite use case for clouds and I really wish more people would take a look at the API and realize how powerful it is to really be able to spin up what you want when you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dig that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So not being technical minded, [00:28:00] but how do you talk to those agencies? If I put on that hat and you talk to me for a second, you\'re like, Hey, here\'s some ways, but that seems like, for instance, on an API perspective, is customize it for your unique need. This is that last percentage where you\'re like, I\'m, we\'re never gonna be able to do these things, but we can put the API out here that allows those kind of custom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything specifically</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> St Yeah. Yeah, I mean, every company is, uh, I guess engineering, you know, uh, what\'s the word? Oh boy, uh, engineering resource constrain these days. So while there\'s a ton of cool stuff we like to do, some of it\'s gonna be edge cases, so we just wanna be able to say, Hey, you know, let us help you walk through this, you know, we\'ll guide you through any questions you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then run with it, you know, this is, it\'s full tested, uh, in, you know, in production api. It\'s the API we use. So it\'s not like , you know, if we sign, find something wrong with it, we\'re the first ones to know. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Awesome. Okay. API big one. Make use of [00:29:00] that. Anything else stand out to you? Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> You know, on sort of the almost new user aspect, uh, I, I, I would like people to understand the variety of applications they can actually deploy. So, yes, you know, I\'m always gonna have my cloud way\'s WordPress head on, but if you\'re working in Laville, And, you know, or other custom PHP stuff, you can still deploy those applications with one click, or at least the framework with one click and be ready to go on, you know, on one or more, uh, servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, uh, you know, being able to just take advantage of that pretty quickly or ask questions about that we\'re. Always interested in people\'s opinions and questions and suggestions. I mean, we literally had, uh, a suggestion come over, uh, the wire this morning, which was like, duh, why haven\'t we done that? Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause you know, you sometimes you just get myopic on, you know, you\'re sitting in your, uh, you know, cubicle and, uh, what\'s a [00:30:00] cubicle? I, I think we don\'t use those . Um, but you know, you know too much about your product and you just make assumptions and that\'s, that\'s always tricky to. People internally to be like, oh yeah, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duh. So as I talk to ask questions more, reach out to us, uh, you know, good, bad or ugly, uh, you know, that\'s, that\'s always one of those things. Feedback\'s never useless. It\'s, it can just be sometimes interesting . And that\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> an advantage of having Robert and Slack as well. So you can hit, you can hit up Robert and Slack too, and give.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback or ask some questions too, or he can point you in the right direction. But what I heard from you, um, too, is that it\'s, even though you are passionate about WordPress at Cloud Ways, cloud Ways is passionate about WordPress, it\'s not just. WordPress and I talk a lot to a lot of, uh, agency owners, particularly in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it\'s interesting because I, I too have just won the WordPress hat for years and I, [00:31:00] and it\'s refreshing to hear what all these agencies are doing, but it\'s not just what, there\'s a lot of tools out there that they might go, I talked to one last week and they\'re doing API develop. With like dairy farmers and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\'s, so what I hear you saying too is like, it\'s, even though we\'re having a WordPress conversation related to cloud wastes, it\'s not just cloud wastes. You can do other other</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> things with it. Oh, for sure. And I, I, I\'ll put my agency hat back on and, you know, we were a jula shop easily. 50% of the work we did was not ju.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, direct, it was maybe tied into it, but there were custom applications, uh, maybe some kind of server architecture that we were building out. Um, you know, crazy database thing. Um, JUUL was a part of it, but then we needed to have other environments to support whatever other, uh, platforms we were, uh, integrating with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gotcha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> All right. Anything else on the making the most part, things [00:32:00] you wish people knew about or did? Uh, before we start talking about, I want to get your takes on the future where WordPress is too, and technology and vision values and things like that. But anything else on the making the most part that you wanna mention?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> APIs, reaching out, uh, you know, play with all the tools. We have a lot of, you know, sometimes people just do that one click and, uh, You know, skip over some of the, you know, interesting features that are already available to them. You know, we have different types of caching that are already available. Um, yes, it gets a little more geeky and you have to know what you\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yes. Um, but I mean, you can go all the way up to, you know, sort of, uh, enterprise esque, uh, CloudFlare, and uh, you know, that\'s pretty cool. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> should have asked this earlier, but a lot of the, it seems like a lot of the, uh, customers you have, or at least the contact points with cloud ways or they\'re using the platform, might be more developer, technical minded people too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So can you speak? So that really speaks to them in the sense of get in there and play around. [00:33:00] They might not, okay, I\'m thinking solution and I just need this fixed. But there\'s also other things that they can get in, explore. Anything, particularly if we put on that developer and agency type role and like, what else would you say to</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, well, a lot of that developer-centric nature comes from being a completely self-service. You know, provider for a long time. Uh, you know, we\'re expanding how we reach out, how we communicate, how we, uh, expose offerings. But, you know, make sure you use, you know, a lot of the basics. Make sure you\'re using , the staging environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'re already there. They\'re not gonna anything extra. Uh, take advantage of. You know, evaluating, you know, potentially different servers or how you, uh, load up on, you know, droplets or something like that. Uh, you may find that, uh, one application is really, you know, kind of, [00:34:00] uh, what\'s the, uh, impacting, that\'s the word I wanna look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>sometimes hard find these, these seven letter words, um, impacting, you know, other applications. You know, never thought about it before, but you can actually tell now the difference. And so yeah, move that over to another, uh, you know, add an extra droplet into the, uh, mix and, and also play around with, uh, how you might split up that architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I\'m, I get, I get geeky on this, but you know, no geek geeky. We, we, uh, uh, we have a customer. Yeah, put their entire database on a really high performant droplet, because that was getting hammered all the time by the type of applications that they were running, but their front end wasn\'t really that busy, so they could, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put multiple versions and variations of that front end on a much more, uh, cost efficient, you know, value based, uh, package. So you can do [00:35:00] cool things like that without having to, uh, go crazy and worry about, you know, third party, you know, database as a service, things. I mean, it\'s already there. Um, so you can kind of take advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Get</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> in and look around the API and, uh, you play with the tools. Okay. Thanks for that, Robert. Now let\'s talk about, I want the, the part that I can talk better about is where is WordPress now in the open web, in the web in general? Um, where\'s the position, what are you seeing in WordPress? What are you excited about with WordPress as we kind of move forward and continue to like help democratize publish?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Uh, well, WordPress is the defacto content management system platform right now. I, I, I don\'t think there\'s any way just by the sheer volume, the ubiquity, the types of traffic. Uh, there are probably a hundred million people on a WordPress site right now. They don\'t even realize it, [00:36:00] so it, it, it, there, there\'s a ubiquity to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, that\'s not gonna disappear overnight. Uh, My assumption is it\'ll continue growing. It\'s, it\'s, there are a lot of things that have been done right with WordPress. There\'s a lot of, you know, quarreling, cobbling, squabbling, um, sometimes about how things get deployed and rolled out. But, uh, on the whole of, for a community driven project, it\'s pretty amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How far it\'s come, how far it\'s going to go, and, uh, the breadth of, of adoption. It\'s, it\'s, is it the easiest thing the universe to use? No, but it\'s not the hardest, uh, is, is, is it the most flexible thing? It\'s up there. I mean, there may be things, you know, if you really wanna just hand code everything from scratch, I guess that\'s the most flexible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this allows a level of [00:37:00] consistency, uh, comfort. I know it\'s not a word we typically use with open source projects, but I can go from one word press site to another for completely different applications, and there\'s a comfort in knowing where all the pieces are and that there\'s documentation and training and all these things that help continue to grow an ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That at some point everyone knows at least enough about WordPress to be dangerous and people can build careers and companies out of it, uh, quite easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Absolutely. Is there anything about in the project too that you like that\'s getting you excited? Uh, whether it\'s, um, a particular market that\'s able to really crush or, you know, cont not crush, crush in a good way, um, really expand into, and I think of enterprise here, so I\'m baiting you on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But um, also specific features. Do you know we got good word, the code editor. Or the block editor always. We\'ve got side editor coming out now, changed from full side editing, but anything, anything that [00:38:00] you, you\'re excited about specifically related to the project that</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> it\'s doing? I think there\'s, uh, small stuff being done and you kind of, you know, um, lob the pitch at me, uh, to, to get enterprise just sort of, uh, happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, there\'s a. Performance work being done all the time on WordPress there, you know, there\'s, uh, you know, WordPress learnings now, I mean, these are the things the enterprise cares about. They wanna be performant, they wanna be secure, and they wanna know that there\'s a knowledge repository that they can go back to, uh, either for reference or for training their workers or being able to evaluate their workers against, or contractors, uh, vendors or whatnot that kind of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s risk mitigation. And the enterprise cares about mitigating this kind of risk. And that\'s why open source had such a hard time in the beginning, and new projects have such a hard time getting traction. There\'s a lot of risk, you know, who\'s running the project. Uh, [00:39:00] you know, are they awake? What happens if something is horribly broken?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if there\'s a, a core vulnerability that destroys everything? You know, these corporations don\'t, the enterprises not wanna worry about those things. They do, but you know, let\'s not make it even scarier than it already is for them. And I think what you know, the project has done very well is try to cover some of these aspects and, uh, provide that faith and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I, I have no enterprise experience, um, but I love that WordPress is, seems to be really doing well on an enterprise. And I hear from a lot of marketing types in those companies that love WordPress, cuz it\'s. Faster, cheaper, and oh, we can actually make side changes on the side. Like they can actually use Gutenberg block editor to roll out things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s exciting for me. I, I came in from more the, here\'s your $80 theme, but to [00:40:00] see WordPress release, start to take. Take a lot of ground up there and help a lot of people, particularly at the enterprise is exciting. Talking with a lot of our agency owners. Same. Same thing is like, that was music to my ears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s what you want to hear WordPress is doing, um, is continue to grow in the new markets and help with that expansion of the.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Of the open web and even things like headless. I mean, so again, you have all that consistency and reliability for from cord WordPress, but now I can just spit out my whole site via APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you could always kind of do that, but now it just gets better and more robust and, uh, again, uh, mitigates risk by being able to have the worker\'s stuff on one end and then sort of the display part on the other end. All right. Well,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> thank you for that. Anything else you\'re excited about, uh, the work you\'re doing at Cloud Ways, the work in WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything else that we left out that you want to share? Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> there\'s so many things I\'d love to share. , uh, it\'s, it\'s, it\'s [00:41:00] a busy good time for WordPress. I know there\'s a lot of concern about, in the tech Mark about what\'s going on with this or what\'s going on with that. One of the amazing things about, you know, successful open source project, Is that the opportunities exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, if you\'re, if you\'re a Linux geek, you, you, there are so many millions of opportunities If you\'re a WordPress developer, implementer, you know, uh, editor, content creator, you know, those opportunities are all over the place. And, and it\'s, it\'s, you know, nice from. You know, working in this space now that, okay, the, you know, this is not just a one trick pony, this isn\'t the, you know, some kind of project, which may, may be fantastic or may just drop dead tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, WordPress is, uh, It\'s solid and we should really take an immense amount of pleasure in the fact that it\'s solid. Yes, we\'re not getting things always done as quickly [00:42:00] or, you know, can\'t make everyone happy. But that\'s, that\'s not the worst problem to have in the universe. Uh, it\'s the project. And the platform is flexible enough to accommodate well third party solutions that can integrate with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, why not? And that kind of stability helps everyone from the enterprise on. Yeah, that\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> a good way to end it. Well, thank you my friend Robert, and also the cloud ways for continuing to support business award press at post status. And I love what you\'re doing over there. Keep it up and keep sharing, uh, what you and your team are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will you be you and the team? Um, where will you be next? I know Word Camp are coming around, but, uh, where will you be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Yeah, a deploy, depending when this gets pushed out, there\'s a digital Deploy, digital Ocean Deploy conference, uh, virtual conference that that\'ll probably pass by the time this, uh, airs, uh, recurring revenue summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, all the Black Friday, cyber Monday madness that we, uh, are [00:43:00] already kicking off. Um, I, I think that\'ll, I think that\'ll finish out the year. I think the, uh, we\'ll, we\'ll all take a needed, uh, break at, you know, for at least a week or two at the end of December,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> break and kick into 2023. Well, thanks, Robert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, we appreciate you sharing the story and what you\'re doing, uh, with the product, WordPress product specifically over at Cloud Waste. We\'ll talk to you next time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Robert Jacobi:</strong> Thanks so much, Corey.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 03:24:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Sandbox Project Demos: Test-Drive Themes and Plugins in the Browser\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140222\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-sandbox-project-demos-test-drive-themes-and-plugins-in-the-browser\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4025:\"<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-sandbox\">WordPress Sandbox</a>, an experimental project that uses WebAssembly (WASM) to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-prototype-runs-wordpress-in-the-browser-with-no-php-server\">run WordPress in the browser without a PHP server</a>, has been chugging along steadily since Automattic-sponsored core contributor Adam Zieliński introduced it earlier this year in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zieliński published three new updates to Twitter this week, demonstrating the project&#8217;s potential to provide an in-browser IDE for plugin development along with a quick way to spin up a test environment for themes and plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first example, he shows how the project could be used to test-drive themes from WordPress&#8217; Themes Directory right in the browser. Clicking the <a href=\"https://t.co/nYDjXUAwLv\">demo URL</a> will launch a site with the Pendant theme active, but the theme can be changed to another from the directory by appending a different theme name to the end of the URL. All your changes made on the demo are private and disappear after a page refresh. With a few improvements, this could be transformative for previewing themes on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With WordPress Sandbox, you can test-drive themes from the directory right in your browser.<br /><br />For example, click here to try Pendant theme:<a href=\"https://t.co/nYDjXUAwLv\">https://t.co/nYDjXUAwLv</a><br /><br />You can replace \"pendant\" in the URL with another theme from the directory. <a href=\"https://t.co/OFGqimFd6c\">pic.twitter.com/OFGqimFd6c</a></p>&mdash; Adam Zieliński (@adamzielin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamzielin/status/1600484342588997634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 7, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Zieliński also showed WordPress Sandbox&#8217;s potential for test-driving plugins directly in the browser. The example uses CoBlocks but can be changed to any other plugin from the directory by replacing the plugin name. Having this available to WordPress users would greatly speed up the plugin selection process in cases where it&#8217;s not clear if a plugin will do what you hope it will do. It would also be handy if you could append multiple plugin slugs to the URL to install more than one.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">With WordPress Sandbox, you can test-drive plugins from the directory right in your browser.<br /><br />For example, click here to try CoBlocks:<a href=\"https://t.co/18jTGosPW7\">https://t.co/18jTGosPW7</a><br /><br />You can replace \"coblocks\" with another plugin from the directory. <a href=\"https://t.co/zzelQNtzK2\">pic.twitter.com/zzelQNtzK2</a></p>&mdash; Adam Zieliński (@adamzielin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamzielin/status/1600482887710789635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 7, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent demo is a video showing how the project can be used to create an in-browser IDE for plugin development, where changes are displayed live.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The future of WordPress development?<br /><br />Build plugins in your browser and see the results live.<br /><br />Here\'s an early demo with WordPress Sandbox – there is no WordPress running on the backend! <a href=\"https://t.co/yIhRoNW5IK\">pic.twitter.com/yIhRoNW5IK</a></p>&mdash; Adam Zieliński (@adamzielin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamzielin/status/1600837230779580416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 8, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>For more examples of WordPress Sandbox&#8217;s capabilities, check out the quick <a href=\"https://adamziel.github.io/tutorial.html\">showcase</a> Zieliński built and play around with a <a href=\"https://adamziel.github.io/index.html\">live in-browser WordPress instance</a> to see the site updated instantly as you code. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Dec 2022 01:41:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: Course: A New Free Block Theme Compatible with Sensei LMS\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/course-a-new-free-block-theme-compatible-with-sensei-lms\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2136:\"<p>Sensei LMS, Automattic&#8217;s teaching and learning management plugin, has released a new free block theme called <a href=\"https://senseilms.com/meet-course-a-new-free-block-theme-by-sensei/\">Course</a>.

WordPress.org&#8217;s Meta Team is now experimenting with how they can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/2022/12/introducing-the-block-editor-in-the-support-forums/\">bring the block editor into the support forums</a>. That they are even considering this is a testament to how far the block editor has come, as the support forums provide a critical lifeline for WordPress users who are struggling with their websites and wouldn&#8217;t benefit from adopting a buggy editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The support forums have a long history in WordPress,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored contributor Alvaro Gómez said. &#8220;So much so that the current forum editor predates TinyMCE. By introducing blocks, the support forum will make use of the modern WordPress editor to improve user experience. Users will be able to easily insert links, share code or embed screenshots. Using Blocks will also enable new possibilities, such as using patterns for common responses to allow for faster answers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the technical difficulty of how the forums currently work, the block editor would need to be rolled out to all users on all forums, precluding the possibility of rolling it out on a per-user, per-language, or per-forum basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6608\">ticket</a> opened six days ago, Meta contributors discussed bringing the block editor to the support forums using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/blocks-everywhere/\">Blocks Everywhere</a> plugin by Automattic. This plugin switches the default WordPress editor for comments, bbPress, BuddyPress, and admin moderation to use Gutenberg, giving users access to blocks. Instead of bundling Gutenberg, it side-loads the editor from WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meta and Support teams intend to start with just four blocks available to forum users: paragraph, list, quote, and code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gómez shared a few GIFs from a test site, demonstrating a user responding on a thread using the block editor:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Another item on the roadmap is creating an &#8220;add via URL&#8221; image block that would allow users to embed from various image hosting services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A live testing site is available at <a href=\"https://test.wordpress.org/support/\">https://test.wordpress.org/support/</a> and anyone who wants to join in the testing can leave a comment on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/2022/12/introducing-the-block-editor-in-the-support-forums/\">announcement post</a>. Bugs can be filed on the meta trac <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6608\">ticket</a> for the improvement to the forums. The Meta and Support teams are looking for feedback before Monday, December 12.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Dec 2022 23:40:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:153:\"Post Status: Annual Survey • State of the Word 2022 • LearnWP Site Updates • Block Editor in Support Forums • Dev Guide to Block Theme Course Pt2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=145643\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:148:\"https://poststatus.com/annual-survey-state-of-the-word-2022-learnwp-site-updates-block-editor-in-support-forums-dev-guide-to-block-theme-course-pt2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13813:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-december-5-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (December 5, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">It\'s time once again to share your feedback about all things WordPress in the 2022 survey.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, multi-author collaboration in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, well, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you. And hopefully get you, or your idea, featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Steve Burge. Although Steve is originally from England, he now lives in Sarasota, Florida. He leads the team at PublishedPress, which is a plugin company focusing on improving the publishing experience for WordPress users. The topic of today&#8217;s podcast is very much in his wheelhouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago, the block editor was brought into WordPress core. It was a dramatic change from the classic editor. Pages and posts could be created and edited with a growing variety of blocks. Blocks for paragraphs blocks for images, in fact blocks for everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ability to edit content with blocks was just one of four phases of the Gutenberg project. The other three phases being site editing, multi-author collaboration and multi-lingual support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been following recent developments, then you&#8217;ll know that we&#8217;re currently in the site editing phase. And when that&#8217;s done, it will be time to turn our collective attention to multi-author collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what is that? And what does it mean? I think that the best way to think about this would be to imagine Google docs. For years, you&#8217;ve been able to open up a document, click a button and share that document with others. Those with the correct permissions can interact with you in real time. And you can see the amendments they&#8217;re making as and when they&#8217;re making them. It&#8217;s utterly brilliant, and how most people would prefer to work with their content. One document. One source of truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare that to how WordPress currently works. Only one person can edit a piece of content at the same time. If you want to edit a post or a page at the same time as someone else, you can&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase three of the Gutenberg project aims to bring into WordPress the ability for multiple users to interact with content at the same time. Steve talks today about why this is an elegant and necessary update to WordPress. But also why it&#8217;s a difficult feat of engineering to pull off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has a history of working with all manner of hosting configurations, and it&#8217;s one of the reasons that it&#8217;s so successful. Will it be possible to run WordPress on more affordable tech stacks given the burden that multi author collaboration will require?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the projects that Steve has found from community members, which try to lay some of the foundations of how this might be implemented, as well as talking about how Steve&#8217;s finding it hard to discover new information concerning this important topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more. You can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Steve Burge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Steve Burge. Hello Steve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:29] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Hey, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Steve and I met not that long ago. It was WordCamp US. We met for the very first time. Because he was at WordCamp US, you can pretty much guarantee that he&#8217;s into WordPress. But as we always do at the beginning of the podcast episode, just to orientate the listeners, Steve, about who you are and what your relationship is with WordPress. You can go back as far as you like, could be last year, could be 10 years ago. Tell us a bit about your WordPress journey, and then we&#8217;ll get into the subject of today&#8217;s podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:57] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Sure thing. I&#8217;m from England. I live in Florida in the US, and I&#8217;ve been dabbling in open source since about 2003, 2004 or so. And ran a training company for a long time called OS Training, and we were involved in publishing. We published a lot of videos and also a whole series of books on WordPress, Drupal, Magento, php. And about five years ago flipped into developing plugins, and so we went right into the publishing side of WordPress plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we run three different plugin brands now, all focused on publishing. One is PublishPress, one is TaxoPress and one is Meta Slider. And that&#8217;s really kind of what led me to this interest in Gutenberg phase three. We work with a lot of publishers and to have the kind of collaborative editing that should be coming in phase three is really exciting for a lot of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Can I just pause the podcast general subject, which is, as you&#8217;ve just described the Gutenberg editor and phase three in particular, collaborative editing. Can I ask, because you ran OS Training, which I&#8217;m sure many people will have heard of, they might have books on their shelf or content on the computer and used it in the past. I certainly did. When you came into WordPress, was it your experience from having a real deep background in publishing that made you interested in publishing inside of WordPress? Because obviously your career now is very much tied up with publishing content, collaborative publishing permissions, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Yes, partly. We had to do a lot of co-authoring of books. I wrote initially the first three or four books in our series, and then we started to work with authors. We had to do a lot of co-authoring. We worked with some big publishers like Pearson, and often collaboration involved, sending Word documents back and forth endlessly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you are working on chapter three. The first draft would be chapter_2.1 .doc. You&#8217;d edit it, send the Word document back, word document back and forth, and collaborative editing in those days would mean you got to like 250 Word documents for chapter two, and the name would be confused and you&#8217;d make an edit and your editor would say, oh, which document are we working on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I worked on the wrong document. I imagine now if we were able to do that kind of book publishing, but collaboratively online in something like a Google Docs style environment, my life would&#8217;ve been much, much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m kind of imagining that literally anybody under the age of 25, is probably completely unfamiliar with a world in which technology wasn&#8217;t synchronous. So I don&#8217;t exactly remember the date it happened, but the first time I ever saw synchronous editing on a screen was, I guess I was sitting in my house and Google came out with a product called Google Wave.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if you remember that? Much like a lot of Google properties it&#8217;s now been mothballed and no longer in existence. But essentially for the very first time, you could open a document in a browser and you were able to see other people&#8217;s edits in real time. The cursor would appear and it would&#8217;ve a different color, and you could see that Joseph over here was writing text and Pauline over here, she was writing texts and it was all happening on the screen at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I remember at that point feeling that it was sublimely clever. I genuinely mean that. I&#8217;m not just saying that for the purposes of this podcast. I really did have a moment where breathed in and thought, boy, we&#8217;re not going back from here. This is the way it&#8217;s always going to be done from now on. It&#8217;s completely normal. Just about everybody, I would imagine, like I say, under the age of 25 is probably, this is the only way to do things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hand documents in online easily, and your tutors or peers or whoever it might be, your boss, can give you realtime feedback. And there&#8217;s one canonical version of the document, so you don&#8217;t have to keep sending it via email and adding .1, .2, .3 to the end of it, and so on. And it just seems that&#8217;s so straightforwardly the way it should be done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:05] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> You end up with a, an undo and a back and forward button and everything is just, there&#8217;s no revisions. There&#8217;s, well, technically there are revisions, I guess, but so much easier to handle. I guess the big difference is all of those are often done on one central platform. Google Drive, Google Wave, back in the day. Just yesterday my kid was doing her homework with a friend and they were doing this collaborative editing online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was Microsoft, because that&#8217;s what the school gives them. They&#8217;re on FaceTime, happily chatting back and forth while working on the shared document. But all of that was done on a big central shared server, on the Microsoft server or the Google servers. And it does get more complicated when it comes down to doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah so, we&#8217;ve got all of this positivity around collaborative editing, and the fact that more or less, everybody now understands that paradigm, and it basically is the way to edit documents, for most people at least anyway. You may have instances where you just want something to be completely private and you don&#8217;t want it to be in the cloud, and so it is still done in a, an old fashioned document, which is saved away, and you edit it yourself, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you open up a WordPress website and you are confronted with a completely different paradigm. You&#8217;ve got the option to create content of whatever type you like, text and images may be the, the most common use case. But you are utterly constrained in your collaborations. The best that you&#8217;ve got at the moment is, you go to edit a document, if somebody else is editing it, you get a little warning telling you that somebody else is editing and you can either back out or you can take over. In other words, you can kick them out, and they&#8217;re your two choices. And so it must seem to people coming to WordPress, like I say, under the age of 25, let&#8217;s keep going with that paradigm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It must seem that WordPress is something from like a time machine. What do you mean I can&#8217;t edit it at the same time? Of course I must be, I&#8217;m doing something wrong. But it cannot be done at the moment, but it is in the pipeline. And maybe Steve, you could just lay out the four phases of the Gutenberg project so that we can see where this fits into that jigsaw puzzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:19] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Sure thing. So this dates back to about 2018 or so, when, I think that was when Matt said we&#8217;re not just doing Gutenberg, but Gutenberg is going to be a big four phase product. We&#8217;re going to have one, the actual Gutenberg editor inside the posts. And that one shipped in WordPress 5.0. Then we would tackle full site editing, which I think has just been renamed to the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:52] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> And that one shipped at the beginning of this year I think, in 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I think 5.9 was what&#8217;s in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:59] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> And we are in that stage two, which is customization. And then they&#8217;re going to be two more phases. And one we&#8217;re talking about is the next one up, phase three, called collaboration, which has the Google Doc style editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the fourth and final one is going to be multilingual, where inside the core you&#8217;re going to be able to translate every element of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:23] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, so phase three is going to be the main thrust of this podcast. So this is basically what we&#8217;ve just talked about. The ability for multiple people to concurrently edit and leave comments and you visually see on the screen what other people are doing as they&#8217;re doing it. So, I guess the question to begin with is why hasn&#8217;t this been done already? And I don&#8217;t mean that in a cantankerous way. I literally mean to serve that on a plate. Are you able to give an explanation of why this hasn&#8217;t been done already?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:57] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> There are limited resources, and Gutenberg itself was a big project, a big changeover. We still see probably equal usage between Gutenberg and classic editor in the support tickets we get. And then there&#8217;s all the other page builders too. And then an even bigger project was the full site editing, which is still ongoing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the resources have been constrained. It takes a very big team, working very hard, simply to ship what we&#8217;ve been able to ship so far. So that&#8217;s part of it. And also the collaborative editing is just going to be a, quite a difficult challenge I think. Technically, it&#8217;s one thing to run collaborative editing on your Google servers with Google Docs, where you are in control of just about everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you try and do something similar on a $2 a month hosting company, which WordPress is going to have to do, because almost any WordPress feature you ship has to work on any WordPress site anywhere. That&#8217;s when the challenge comes in. If everyone was hosted on WP Engine or WordPress VIP, we probably would&#8217;ve had this already. But actually rolling it out to 50% of the web, and all the different hosting configurations, it&#8217;s going to be a challenge, a technical challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So two reasons there. The first one is the amount of time it&#8217;s taken to get through the first, well, the first stage. And then we&#8217;re, as you said, we&#8217;re in the second stage, the full site editing. I&#8217;m going to link in the show notes to an article that you wrote over on Publish Press several years ago, actually it was 2019. In fact it was almost exactly three years ago. It was written in November, 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at that point you were talking about getting through full site editing, getting through stage one and two, customization, full site editing, and then eventually landing on the collaborative side of things. It was interesting because back then, much more, probably confident in the ability to get through those first two stages because you were pointing to perhaps a date of 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:03] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Oh yeah. Blame me. Those are my guesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s right. But it just goes to show, doesn&#8217;t it, especially the full sight editing is taking a lot longer. And there was never a flag in the sand which said, this is going to be the date that we&#8217;re going to begin. It was very much, these are the things that we want to achieve, but there&#8217;s no date in mind. So it took a lot longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you mentioned the fact that yes, it&#8217;s all very well working on Microsoft products or Google products, but they own all of that. They&#8217;ve got the infrastructure and it&#8217;s probably, let&#8217;s be honest, pretty impressive infrastructure. And they own the full tech stack, so they can make sure that everything works, and your Google Doc is going to work seamlessly, no matter what level of computing you have at home. You don&#8217;t need a particularly fast computer. It&#8217;s all handled on their end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has a completely different problem. Some people spend a fortune on their hosting because they need it and they&#8217;re happy to do that. Other people spend very little. Sometimes, really, it can be incredibly affordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you able to, I don&#8217;t know if you are, but are you able to go into the technicalities of why cheap hosting wouldn&#8217;t be suitable for, let&#8217;s say something like Google Docs at the moment? In other words, what&#8217;s actually happening when a page is open that two or more people are trying to edit on. And does the problem scale?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there&#8217;s five people editing, is it more resource heavy than if there&#8217;s two people editing or 10 people editing, what have you? So are you able to discuss what the problems are from a technical point of view a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> I&#8217;m not a hardcore developer enough to dig too deep into this without embarrassing myself, but it is very process heavy, and you need some kind of a central server or perhaps a peer-to-peer network that is able to be a central source of truth for what is the latest update and to connect the two together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve looked at different approaches that people have taken to doing this. One of the most common ways is web sockets. Which are able to update the content on the screen without refreshing the whole page. Which is a key part of this because both people need to see their page refreshing in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago that was impressive to do with Ajax. We&#8217;re doing a much more advanced version of that now with both people seeing live updates on the content without refreshing their page. So you need some way to connect the two or three or four or five people who are doing those updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And web sockets is perhaps the most popular way to do it. It&#8217;s basically an API to send messages and responses back and forth. But the limitation there is, some of the low budget hosting companies are not able to do it. And you do need some kind of a central service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of me wonders whether, I don&#8217;t know if they would do this, but if they&#8217;ve thought about perhaps running it through the WordPress.com or WordPress.org infrastructure, in order to make this work for low end hosts. Because they do need some kind of, like Google servers or Microsoft servers, some kind of centralized server would be a massive benefit to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alternative, which I&#8217;ve dug into most, is from a company called Tag One in Europe. They&#8217;re like a big, a big agency and they&#8217;ve been developing a script called YJS, which allows you to do collaborative editing through a peer to peer network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a pretty different solution to web sockets, but it seems to be, and I&#8217;m guessing here, the one that the Gutenberg team have taken on board. There seems to have been a bit of radio silence on the technical side of things. We&#8217;ve seen Matt mention phase three at a couple of State of the Words. He talked about it in Europe a little bit, in Lisbon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;ve been trying to pull the strings on the technical side of things on GitHub, and there&#8217;s not much there at the moment. I think from what I&#8217;ve been told, that there&#8217;s action going on in private. They&#8217;re working on it in the background and perhaps on some private repositories. But the only real thing that&#8217;s emerged, at least, someone feel free to correct me on this, is a script called an Isolated Block Editor, which basically takes Gutenberg as a kind of standalone product that I think could be used in Tumblr, or the Day one app, or Drupal or anywhere else. And it&#8217;s kind of building in collaborative editing into that isolated block editor, which is a version of Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So really the technical hints that I&#8217;ve heard about this, are two or three years old. We did a big interview on the PublishPress blog with the YJS team, where they dig into some of the technical challenges around this. But from everything I&#8217;ve been able to read or talk about with people, it&#8217;s a real technical challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CK Editor team, WordPress uses TinyMCE. CK Editor is kind of an alternative to TinyMCE. They have a really long and detailed blog post about how they tried to build collaborative editing into their, into their editor editor. It took four plus years, and I think ended up with lots of them tearing their hair out and growing prematurely gray. And there&#8217;s a Twitter thread from a guy who tried to do this with Microsoft Office. He basically says the same thing. Just an enormous technical challenge is particularly in retrospect, to try and take existing software and add collaborative editing to it. But, and this is one of the reasons why I wonder if they&#8217;re thinking about some kind of a central server, for example, WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re finally starting to see the possibility of collaborative editing coming soon. Automattic have a product called P2, which is I think used for their internal blogs, their internal networking. And just in the last month or so, they have an update on the P two blog. They&#8217;ve been rolling out collaborative editing to some of their P2 users. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m on a blacklist or something, but I&#8217;ve been sending several messages to the WordPress.com staff seeing if I can get in on the beta invite list. But no luck so far. So collaborative editing is actually live on WordPress.com for some users at the moment, and I can share the link that you can put in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But down in their, in the documentation they have about it, they say that it&#8217;s a work in progress, it&#8217;s a beta. It can become unstable under some circumstances. If you are running a VPN or some kind of a proxy, often if you&#8217;re using Safari, it can become unstable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is kind of a long winded answer to your original question. The technical side is a little bit of a mystery still. I suspect that YJS will play a part. I suspect they may be working on some kind of a central server to make it stable to run on those $2 a month hosting companies. And if you go over to the P2 area on WordPress.com, there&#8217;s a little video of it emerging, and collaborative, editing, we may start to see a lot more of it in the next few months suspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There was a lot in there, wasn&#8217;t there? And I&#8217;m just going to go through some of the thoughts that were coming into my head as you were saying it. So the first one is obviously people like Google, they&#8217;ve completely cracked this nut. I cannot remember a time at any point where my Google doc froze, for example. Or I was editing it with somebody else, and they seemed to sort of blip out of existence. Suddenly 20 lines got updated when it looked like they weren&#8217;t even editing the document. In other words, they were always typing. I could see them typing. It was as if they were right next to me in many senses. No problems in other words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:04] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Is a beautiful experience when it works well, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:06] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But I&#8217;m guessing that could be the problem, couldn&#8217;t it? You know, if somebody has infrastructure running their WordPress website, and it simply isn&#8217;t up to the task. I don&#8217;t fully understand what that means, but we all know that computers given a certain volume of things to do, tend to grind down and prioritize some things over others, and in some cases just cease to function and collapse. But if you were editing a document, you mentioned a source of truth. You have to know, don&#8217;t you? You really have to be confident that what you are seeing on the screen now, is what the final version is looking like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t be in a situation where, I&#8217;ve got you Steve over there. You are editing, I&#8217;m editing this document, and it looks to me like you finished because you are no longer contributing. And it turns out you&#8217;d written another couple of hundred words, which never made it into the document because your system collapsed in the background. And I didn&#8217;t know about that, and that would truly be a calamity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also imagine collisions in terms of things getting overwritten or me saving a document in some way that then removes the possibility of your a hundred words ever making it in there in the first place. So there&#8217;s all these really big problems and as you say, the very fact that we are all using different qualities of hardware, different computers, different versions of Linux, all sorts of different engines going on in the background, powering our websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has to be some way of figuring out what the source of truth is at this moment. And I really do, kind of understand a little bit more now that that really is genuinely a tricky challenge and one that perhaps hasn&#8217;t been faced by another company. Also, your idea of it being a dot com type thing. In other words, this capability is offloaded to, let&#8217;s say, some sort of Automattic property.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:59] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> I would put a caveat in there that that is entirely my guess. I have no, no evidence to that at all. I&#8217;ve just been thinking through possible solutions to the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But I find that to be quite an interesting solution. So again, let&#8217;s assume that this collaborative editing is something that everybody aspires to. But we can also agree that if you have incredibly modest hosting, it may be something that your aspirations aren&#8217;t living up to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, maybe there is a sort of commercial angle for having that capability built on top of affordable hosting, if you know what I mean. In other words, WordPress.com, whichever company it may be, I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s some kind of upgrade. You have a WordPress website, but you would like the collaborative editing capability to be added in, simply because you know that your infrastructure can&#8217;t cope with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that&#8217;s less than ideal. I think it would be the ideal that any architecture can cope with it. That would be obviously ideal. But it was an interesting thought, and it just sort of prompted me to think, I wonder if even a company as large as Automattic, I wonder if they could saddle the burden of all of that given that there wouldn&#8217;t be any commercial side to paying off that debt, if you know what I mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there&#8217;s 40% of the web, let&#8217;s say 20% of those websites can&#8217;t manage it, and so they&#8217;re doing their collaborative editing on Automattic&#8217;s hardware. Presumably there&#8217;s a bill for that, which would need to be paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:33] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> I mean, that&#8217;s part of the problem of being WordPress, right? You&#8217;re trying to solve problems at a scale that no one else has ever solved it. We talked about CK Editor for example, Well, CK Editor has collaborative editing. It took them four years and just about burned out some of the best developers. But there were tiny fraction of the size of WordPress, and what WordPress needs to do. I guess until we, until more of this starts to emerge, perhaps when the full site editing winds down, we&#8217;re not going to know too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think the two options available are either to build a peer to peer network, using something like YJS or to go through the centralized option of WordPress.com .org or an other service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I wonder if there&#8217;s other options that could be explored. And forgive me, my technical ignorance here might be screaming loudly at you as I say these words, but I wonder if it might be possible to have a scenario in which you are alerted to the fact that changes have been made, but you have to, I don&#8217;t know, maybe click a button or.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:42] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> We have lost a connection. There&#8217;d be some kind of mess. I guess the most common point of failure for collaborative editing will probably be, the connection is lost, and each person goes back to editing their own separate version of the document. You just lose the collaboration aspect, and there could be some kind of message saying you have disconnected from the collaborative editing, you have disconnected from the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yes. And of course that throws up all sorts of enormously difficult problems on its own. Because then, let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s four people editing the document, do they then carry on? And then those four people have to combine their efforts after the fact to figure out, okay, well what did you do? Which bit did you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can we just copy and paste that in here now? In other words, it makes more of a mess than the old asynchronous way of doing things, where I edit it, hand it to you, you edit it, hand it to person three, they edit it, and it finally comes back to me. And at least I know that those three edits have been made. And that&#8217;s in the scenario of collapse that we just described, we&#8217;d be back to that basically. And obviously if we&#8217;re offering the promise of collaborative editing, you have to trust it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thought occurred to me is, does it need to be as beautiful, let&#8217;s say as Google Docs? And what I mean by that is, I can literally watch you type letter by letter. I&#8217;ll see each letter coming in one at a time. Does it need to refresh quite as often as that? Is a two second delay, a three second delay, a five second delay. I don&#8217;t know if this adds complexity. I don&#8217;t know if it solves any problems or creates others?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:13] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Well, there is a video on the P2 site. Just a little five second video showing how this works. And it is just like Google Docs to be honest. It has the avatars of the people editing in the top right corner. Each person gets assigned the color. So, if there&#8217;s a little Nathan avatar on the top right, you might have red around your avatar, and any changes you make are being highlighted in red. I might have purple. Any changes I make are being highlighted in purple. It is, at least in this video, aiming right for the Google Drive, Google Docs experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting. In your article, I will link to it, and people can go and find it and there&#8217;s a couple of them in fact, and I&#8217;ll make sure to link to both of those. There was raised, and I can&#8217;t remember whether this was raised and then has now been put to bed, or if it was raised and is still a possibility. In order to try and do this, people are coming up with interesting and clever solutions to sidestep maybe some problems that were becoming obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of being able to only edit the block that you are currently editing by yourself. So in other words, let&#8217;s say for example, if we&#8217;ve got a page and it&#8217;s got 50 paragraphs and a couple of images. I could edit one paragraph, but that paragraph would be locked to you. But all the other 49 paragraphs would be open to anybody. And the first person that gets in there, gets to edit it until they are in effect booted out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;d have a, an option, very similar to what we have now, on a page basis where I can&#8217;t get into the page if somebody else is editing it. We&#8217;d have that on a block by block basis. And I think in many cases that might satisfy 90%, 95% of the problems. What are the chances that I want to edit an image at the same time as you? What are the chances that I want to edit a paragraph at the same time as you? Maybe there&#8217;s a high chance of collision. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:05] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> No, no, I think that kind of thing makes sense. And certainly, while we&#8217;re talking, I have the, the demo video playing on my screen in front of me. And that seems to be what they&#8217;re doing. That it is a block by block approach. I may be wrong. They may have something else in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in the video that I&#8217;m watching, one person is editing the header, one person is editing a table, one person is editing a paragraph, and they&#8217;re working on the same document, but on different blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> One of the things that you introduced to me just before we hit the record button, was there&#8217;s a developer called Riad Benguella, and I&#8217;m sorry, Riad if that is in fact not how you say your name, I do apologize, but I&#8217;ll link to a website that you mentioned in a tweet. I&#8217;ll mention the tweet, and I&#8217;ll post the website URL as well. It&#8217;s Gutenberg with collaborative editing built into it. And you and I were editing on it, ala Google Docs. And it all seemed to work. So obviously there are people who are tackling this problem, but I&#8217;m sure the problem that, that we have here is that we don&#8217;t know what the tech stack is behind it that&#8217;s making it possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re both looking at asblocks.com, a s b l o c k s .com, and you can go there. I suspect it&#8217;s going to be there for years to come, and share. The first person that logs in can share the link, assign themselves a name, and then presumably that shared link looks the same to you. You have to assign yourself a name and we can both see each other editing and it works as far as I can see perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:32] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Yeah, Riad solved this problem two plus years ago with as blocks, and the demo is still live and still working now. It&#8217;s the, the scale out to every WordPress site that is the big stumbling block I presume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, we just simply don&#8217;t know how many people are using this at the same time. And so the collapse of it might not be a problem. Do you have any insight or any kind of spidey sense of when things may start to move in this direction? So obviously we really have to get to the point where full site editing or site editing is more or less complete to the satisfaction of the majority of people, at least anyway. Then we&#8217;ll be working on this thorny problem. Do you have any conception of when the work on this will begin properly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:20] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> I wish I did. To be honest, I&#8217;m a little geeky about this stuff and, our customers want it, and I really wanted it. It would be a wonderful feature for WordPress. So I&#8217;ve probably been following this as closely as anyone that isn&#8217;t actually involved on the technical side. Every time I Google Gutenberg phase three, I seem to come across something I wrote myself, because there&#8217;s not much written about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been done a little bit, not entirely under a veil of secrecy, but maybe they don&#8217;t want to distract from the focus on full site editing. But it has been hard to find information. And so I was happy to see something emerge on the P2 blog that this is in progress still. If I had to guess, we&#8217;ll start to see more next year. We&#8217;ve had a couple of mentions of it from Matt, I mentioned at different WordCamps, and Matias, who is one of the lead developers of Gutenberg since the beginning, has a blog post from June this year on WordPress.org talking about phase three, but really only tangentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was more about the ending of phase two and full site editing. And so there really has been a lot of radio silence. Quite a lot of the active GitHub repos have gone quiet. I hope next year. But as someone who follows this closely, I&#8217;ve not been able to find that anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Everything that I&#8217;ve heard has stuck rigidly to the four phases of Gutenberg. I haven&#8217;t heard of anybody discounting phase three. So collaborative editing I think is definitely destined to be tackled, and hopefully succeeding in tackling. But you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s been very, very quiet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, there&#8217;s a lot of speculation. There might be more proofs of concept or people popping up, giving their insight into it. But as you say, you followed it really, really closely, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s almost like a veil of secrecy, as you said. So hopefully that doesn&#8217;t indicate anything negative. It just means that people are concentrating their efforts on other things and trying to get those things tackled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve, I&#8217;ve probably used up more of your time than I intended to. I&#8217;m sorry about that. Just before we go, if people want to talk to you about this whole proposition, collaborative editing, where&#8217;s the best place to reach out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:32] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> steve@publishpress.com. And actually one of the reasons I wanted to talk about this topic with you was I hoped I might be able to shake a bit more information out of the tree. Someone hears this and has information about it, wants to talk about it, happy to do a video podcast or share the information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love to see this in WordPress. I&#8217;m happy to help. I&#8217;m sure they have the reasons for keeping it, for keeping it quiet to the moment. But, this would be a killer feature for WordPress, and if anyone has more information, I&#8217;d love to hear it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I really think you are right. I think the realization of this in Gutenberg and if we had an implementation which worked basically effectively for everybody, the day it was released into WordPress core. I think it will really, would dramatically change the prospects of what people would wish to do with WordPress. At the moment it&#8217;s largely for websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really genuinely could be a tool for all sorts of internal communications and publishing things that just are for your close network, your job, your industry, whatever it might be. There&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a whole lot that could happen that at the minute is probably left to the likes of Microsoft Teams and Google Docs and all of that kind of stuff, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:43] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Well, it did pop up on P2 initially, which is the kind of WordPress versions of Google Docs, the kind of internal, Automattic, documentation system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, thank you Steve for chatting to me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:55] <strong>Steve Burge:</strong> Thanks, Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://steveburge.com/\">Steve Burge</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Steve is originally from England, he now lives in Sarasota, Florida. He leads the team at <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/\">PublishPress</a>, which is a plugin company focusing on improving the publishing experience for WordPress users. The topic of today&#8217;s podcast is very much in his wheelhouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago, the block editor was brought into WordPress Core. It was a dramatic change from the classic editor. Pages and posts could be created and edited with a growing variety of blocks. Blocks for paragraphs, blocks for images, in fact, blocks for everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ability to edit content with blocks was just one of four phases of the Gutenberg project, the other three phases being, site editing, multi-author collaboration, and multilingual support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been following recent developments, then you’ll know that we’re currently in the site editing phase. When that’s done, it will be time to turn our collective attention to multi-author collaboration. But what is that and what does it mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that the best way to think about this would be to imagine Google Docs. For years, you’ve been able to open up a document, click a button and share that document with others. Those with the correct permissions can interact with you in real time, and you can see the amendments they’re making as and when they’re making them. It’s utterly brilliant, and how most people would prefer to work with their content. One document. One source of truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare that to how WordPress currently works. Only one person can edit a piece of content at the same time. If you want to edit a post or a page at the same time as someone else, you can’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase three of the Gutenberg project aims to bring into WordPress the ability for multiple users to interact with content at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steve talks today about why this is an elegant and necessary update to WordPress, but also why it’s a difficult feat of engineering to pull off.

That’s what I lost when I turned my hobby into a career.\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#svenska\">Den här essän finns även på svenska.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2012, I was a media and communications student at Umeå University in northern Sweden. The overall state of the newspaper business had convinced me not to pursue a career in journalism, and I had figured the second best thing would be to work with media relations for a business or organization I’d feel passionate about. That’s about how much thought I put into my choice of education. With each lecture I attended and essay I handed in, I realized that I enjoyed studying media and communications, but I wasn’t overly excited about making it my career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the lectures and essays left me enough time to pursue other things as well. Girls, friends, parties – things you’re keen on when you’ve moved to a city 500 kilometers from home – but also side projects. Money is always tight when you’re a student. I had started to consider different ways of making money from the web tinkering I’d had as a hobby from an early age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was aware that the business for selling premium WordPress themes was growing rapidly, with themes on websites like ThemeForest making immense amounts of money. Could that be a way to help pay the bills?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_564506-1f wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Finding WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a very clear memory of the first time I wrote HTML. I was eleven years old, and I was browsing a popular link directory called Annas Länkburkar (”Annas link jars”) on one of the computers at school. The front page consisted of rows of jars, bottles, boxes and tea bags, each labeled with the type of links they contained. Somewhere in the dark blue bottle labeled ”Data”, I found a tutorial for writing simple web pages in HTML. My desktop was soon littered with .html files exploring the basics of coding web pages, all carefully written in Notepad. I learned that the email accounts my parents had at the web portal Spray came with member pages with HTML support, and I quickly planted a flag on my first plot of land on the World Wide Web. If I remember correctly, it had the memorable URL of http://medlem.spray.se followed by a random number sequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kept tinkering with web development over the next few years, learning CSS from a book in the library and trying and failing to wrap my head around JavaScript. I was aware of Content Management Systems, but since I couldn’t afford a host on my weekly allowance, I was limited to what I could accomplish on the free web hosts available at the time. I started to play around with other programming languages as well. I found C++ too complicated and Visual Basic dull, but QBasic struck the right balance for me and I built simple ASCII games with it for a while. As you can tell, I was a very cool kid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I switched schools when I was 15, and my interest in computers dipped for a while. Instead, I discovered Photoshop. Most of my output consisted of moody illustrations captioned with song lyrics – the main form of expression for 15-year-olds. I was also tricked into working with the school paper, which lit the spark for my interest in journalism and introduced me to InDesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started high school, back in 2006, the blog phenomenon was just starting to take off in Sweden, and I was eager to jump on the bandwagon. I had gotten it in my head that I was going to develop indie games, and rather than actually spend my time developing games, I decided that the sensible thing to do was to create a blog about indie game development. This would mark the start of a lifelong habit of creating websites about my interests instead of practicing them. A Google search for after free blog services took me to WordPress.com. The service was only a little more than a year old at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I published my first blog post with WordPress on January 14, 2007. I can tell you the date with certainty because I’m looking at the post right now, but no, I won’t share it here. I have already told you about my moody Photoshop illustrations, and there are limits to how much I will embarrass myself in public. Despite the WordPress.com domain name and bad English, I somehow managed to trick a handful of game developers to be interviewed for the blog. Most notably, Doom and Quake co-creator John Romero. My final question was ”Pizza or hamburger?”. Maybe it’s for the best that I didn&#8217;t end up a journalist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My delusions about indie game development soon faded, but I hadn’t lost my interest in blogging. I had grown used to working with WordPress from my WordPress.com blog, so when it came time to register my own domain name and sign up for a proper host, the choice of CMS was an easy one. I dusted off my old HTML and CSS skills to make some small visual tweaks to the theme I was running, and I started to pick up a little bit of PHP as well. I soon realized that tinkering with the code was as much fun as writing blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More sites quickly followed. One with news about Nintendo, one with news about Apple, one link directory, one with tutorials about blogging, one about the murder of Swedish prime minister Olof Palme, and so on. The last one is the only one of them <a href=\"https://palmemordet.se/\">online</a> today, although it has received a couple of visual updates since then. I still get emails from conspiracy loonies every month or so. Almost all of the sites were built with WordPress, usually with a tweaked free or premium theme. I kept updating them through my high school graduation, and after high school, a part time job at a small IT company led to me getting paid to write code for the first time. I still didn’t think of it as a possible career path. I had my eyes set on college.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_5ca9f6-a1 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">A career built on themes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years later, I was sitting in my student apartment in Umeå, thinking about building premium WordPress themes to help pay the bills. Having nothing to lose and spare time on my hands, I decided to give it a go. My first theme was a simple blog theme called Lasseter, named after former Pixar director John Lasseter, and it was released on Mojo Themes in August 2013 for $49. Realizing I needed some way to market my premium themes, I decided to develop free themes for the WordPress.org theme directory as well. Visitors would come to my site for the free themes, and hopefully decide to pay a couple of bucks for a premium theme instead. That was the plan. Things didn’t work out that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I released my first free theme, <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/lingonberry-wordpress-theme/\">Lingonberry</a>, the same month as Lasseter. The Trac ticket for the theme is still <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13558\">live</a>, and the list of issues I had to fix before the theme was approved is a mile long. <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/challenge-gladly-accepted/\">Carolina Nymark</a> of the WordPress.org Theme Review Team reviewed the theme, and she was very patient with me. I had no idea how little I knew about WordPress theme development before I submitted my first theme to WordPress.org. Seven years later, Carolina and I would be co-leads on the &lt;a href=\"http://&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt; &lt;p&gt;I released my first free theme, &lt;a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/lingonberry-wordpress-theme/\"&gt;Lingonberry&lt;/a&gt;, the same month as Lasseter.

I owe her and the other WordPress.org theme reviewers a lot.&lt;/p&gt; <!-- /wp:paragraph -&gt;\"&gt;-->Twenty Twenty</a> default theme in WordPress 5.3. I owe her and the other WordPress.org theme reviewers a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lingonberry-1680x1680-1.jpg\"><img /></a>Lingonberry, my first free WordPress theme.\n\n\n\n<p>There’s something special about seeing people take something you’ve built and do creative things with it, and when Lingonberry went live, it was exciting in a way I have a hard time putting into words. It made me realize I was a lot more eager to see my themes being used than I was making money from them. My next theme, <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/hemingway-wordpress-theme\">Hemingway</a>, was free as well. As was my next one, and the one after that, and all the themes that followed. After a year or two, I decided to remove Lasseter from sale. It had sold maybe ten copies at that point.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During that same time, my free themes had been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times. I was starting to get requests about making paid adjustments to them, and in some cases, building completely custom themes. When I was a couple of months away from graduating college, I received an offer from Smashing WordPress author <a href=\"https://tdh.se\">Thord D. Hedengren</a> to come to Stockholm for a job interview at Odd Alice, his web agency. After 15 years of building web sites as a hobby, the offer was on the table to turn it into a career. I took it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_74b792-05 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">The blessing and the curse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the years that followed, I worked remotely for two years before I moved to Stockholm, went through a breakup, made friends for life and grew both as a person and as a theme developer, experienced a company merger and the implosion of said company, and became a freelancer in November 2019 just months before the pandemic hit. All the while, I kept on releasing free WordPress themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also felt lost. Anyone who has been allowed to turn their hobby into a career – and there are a lot of us in the WordPress community – know that it is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because you’re allowed to spend your nine to five working on something that you’re truly passionate about. A curse because working on your passion from nine to five will result in that passion wearing out and, in periods, be extinguished altogether. This is when a hobby comes in handy. It’s a shame you’ve turned your hobby into a job, isn’t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic was a turning point for me, as it was for so many others. I had increasingly started to feel like a WordPress website generator with legs, and after months of isolation in my studio apartment in Stockholm, I realized I needed a change. I needed something that could give me a sense of purpose and sense of self that isn’t rendered with pixels on a screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_8e86d0-af wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Hike your own hike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The seed was planted during a family trip to Scotland in August 2019. Me, my parents and my siblings were exploring the country by train, and our first stop after leaving Edinburgh was a little town in the Scottish Highlands called Fort William. Fort William lies at the foot of Ben Nevis, the highest mountain in the United Kingdom. It is the end point for the West Highland Way hiking trail to the south and the starting point for the Great Glen Way hiking trail to the north. Early August is peak hiking season, and Fort William was filled with long-distance hikers either finishing their hike or just about to start it. The sight of excited hikers getting ready to head out on the trail stuck with me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I got back to Sweden, I saw that I had received an email asking me whether I’d like to take part in designing the Twenty Twenty default theme in WordPress 5.3. It’s the sort of offer you would kick yourself for life for turning down, so I swallowed all of my anxieties and said yes. The next couple of months were intense. In addition to a hectic work schedule and contributing to Twenty Twenty in the evenings and weekends, me and my partner were separating, I was buying an apartment, and I was transitioning from full-time employment to freelance work. I would watch hiking videos on YouTube to decompress. I watched a lot of hiking videos that fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next spring, as the pandemic shutdown began, I put on my hiking backpack for the first time and headed out for my first night in the wild. Despite a heavy backpack, aching muscles and chafing in all the wrong places, it was love at first sight. That August, a year after the Scotland trip, I did my first long-distance hike in the Swedish mountains. Nine days on the Dag Hammarskjöld trail from Abisko to Nikkaluokta. Hiking had me properly hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/anders-noren-dag-hammarskjoldsleden.jpg\"><img /></a>One of my tent sites on Dag Hammarskjöldsleden, between the Sälka and Singi cabins.\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_b10867-03 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">The missing puzzle piece</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Balance. That’s what I lost when I turned my hobby into a career. When I was a student, I could turn to side projects and theme development for a creative outlet and a change of pace. When I started to work full-time as a theme developer, I still tried to use my themes as that creative outlet, and it only worked to a point. When I finally reached that point, I came very close to burning out on theme development altogether. I started to question my decisions at every fork in the road that had brought me to that chapter in my life. Maybe I should have been a media relations person after all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of us can be all work, all of the time. Finding something that we’re passionate about outside of our day job is key to maintaining balance in our lives. I think that’s especially true for those of us lucky enough to get to turn our hobby into a career. For me, that something turned out to be hiking. Every time I come back from a hike I feel rejuvenated and inspired, with my passion for theme development burning a little bit brighter than when I left. None would have been more surprised than my twelve year old self, with his nose buried in books about C++ and QBasic.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/grona-bandet-map.jpg\"><img /></a>My planned route on Gröna bandet.</div>\n\n\n<p>Next summer, I’ll head out on my biggest adventure yet: A two month hike of the entire Swedish mountain chain, from Grövelsjön in the south to the point where the borders of Sweden, Norway and Finland meet in the north. About 1 300 kilometers in all. The hike is called Gröna bandet, and unlike most long-distance trails, you have to chart your own path from the starting point to the end. A fitting metaphor for a career in WordPress. All of it will be documented in excruciating detail on my <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andersnoren1/\">Instagram</a>, if you’re interested in tagging along.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an immense privilege to be able to go on adventures like this one, and I likely wouldn’t have had that opportunity without the strange career path the WordPress community has given me. For that, I’m incredibly grateful.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"svenska\">Välsignelser och förbannelser med att förvandla sin hobby till en karriär</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>År 2012 var jag en medie- och kommunikationsstudent på Umeå universitet. Mediebranschens nedåtgående kurva hade övertygat mig om att inte satsa på en karrär som journalist, och jag intalade mig själv att det näst bästa var att jobba som kommunikatör på en spännande arbetsplats. Det var ungefär så mycket tanke jag hade lagt bakom mitt val av utbildning. För varje föreläsning jag gick på och uppgift jag lämnade in insåg jag att jag tyckte om att studera kommunikation, men jag var inte särskilt pepp på att göra en karriär av det.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Som tur är gav föreläsningarna och uppgifterna mig tillräckligt tid över för att ta mig an andra saker. Att ändra på min civilstatus, träffa nya vänner, gå på fester – saker man prioriterar när man flyttar till en stad 500 kilometer bort – men också sidoprojekt. Det är tufft att få ihop hushållsbudgeten som student. Jag började överväga olika sätt att tjäna pengar på det webbfixandde jag hade haft som hobby sedan jag var liten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag var medveten om att marknaden för premiumteman för WordPress växte snabbt, och att teman på marknadsplatser som ThemeForest drog in enorma summor. Det kunde kanske vara ett sätt att dryga ut hushållsbudgeten.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_a25f3f-c1 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Mitt möte med WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag har ett väldigt tydligt minne av när jag skrev HTML för första gången. Jag var elva år gammal, och jag utforskade en länksamling som hette Annas Länkburkar i skolans datorsal. I och med att du läser det här på svenska kanske du minns den själv, beroende på när du gick i skolan. Om inte så bestod startsidan på Annas länkburkar av rader med burkar, flaskor, lådor och tepåsar, märkta med den typ av länkar kategorisidorna innehöll. Någonstans i den mörkblåa flaskan märkt ”Data” hittade jag en guide till att skriva enkla webbsidor i HTML. Mitt skrivbord var snart helt belamrat med .html-filer i vilka jag utforskade grunderna i att koda webbsidor. Jag fick veta att e-postkontot som mina föräldrar hade hos webbportalen Spray kom med medlemssidor med HTML-support, och jag planterade snart flaggan i mitt första lilla utrymme på WWW. Om jag minns rätt hade medlemsidan den minnesvärda webbadressen http://medlem.spray.se, följt av en slumpmässig nummersekvens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag fortsatte att experimentera med webbutveckling under de närmaste åren. En bok på Sandvikens folkbibliotek introducerade mig till CSS, och jag försökte och misslyckades också med att lära mig JavaScript. Jag var medveten om att det fanns innehållshanteringssystem redan då, men i och med att det inte fanns utrymme för en serveravgift i min veckopeng fick jag nöja med med vad jag kunde göra med .tk-domännamn och gratis webbhotell. Jag började experimentera med andra programmeringsspråk också. C++ var för komplicerat och Visual Basic för tråkigt, men QBasic träffade rätt och jag byggde enkla ASCII-spel i QBasic under en tid. Som du märker var jag en väldigt cool och populär kille.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag bytte skola när jag var 15 år gammal, och mitt intresse för datorer svalnade under en period. Istället upptäckte jag Photoshop. Mina alster bestod främst av lågmälda illustrationer med utdrag från sångtexter i bildtexten – 15-åringens främsta uttrycksform. Jag blev också lurad att jobba med skoltidningen, vilket väckte mitt intresse för journalistik och introducerade mig till InDesign.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloggfenomenet var precis på väg att ta fart i Sverige när jag började gymnasiet år 2006, och jag var ivrig att haka på. Jag hade fått för mig att jag skulle utveckla indiespel, och istället för att ägna min tid åt att lära mig spelutveckling bestämde jag mig för att starta en blogg om indie-spelutveckling. Det utgjorde starten för en livslång vana av att bygga webbplatser om mina intressen istället för att utöva dem. Efter en snabb Google-sökning efter olika bloggtjänster hamnade jag på WordPress.com. Tjänsten vara bara drygt ett år gammal då.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag publicerade mitt första blogginlägg med WordPress den 14 januari 2007. Jag kan säga datumet med säkerhet för att jag tittar på blogginlägget i detta ögonblick, men nej, jag kommer inte att publicera länken till det här. Jag har redan berättat om mina lågmälda Photoshop-illustrationer, och det finns gränser för hur mycket jag är villig att göra mig till åtlöje i ett publikt forum. Trots WordPress.com-domännamnet och min knackiga engelska lyckades jag övertala en handfull spelutvecklare att bli intervjuade för bloggen. Den mest kända var John Romero, designer av Wolfenstein 3D, Doom och Quake. Min sista fråga var ”Pizza eller hamburgare?”. Det är nog lika bra att jag inte blev journalist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mina dagdrömmar om indie-spelutveckling svalnade snabbt, men jag hade inte förlorat mitt intresse för bloggande. Jag var van vid WordPress efter att använt WordPress.com, så när det blev dags att registrera ett domännamn och bli kund hos ett webbhotell var valet av innehållssystem enkelt. Jag dammade av mina gamla HTML och CSS-kunskaper för att göra mindre justeringar i temat jag använde, och jag började lära mig lite PHP också. Jag insåg snart att det var lika roligt att experimentera med koden som att skriva blogginlägg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fler sajter följde snabbt. En med nyheter om Nintendo, en med nyheter om Apple, ett länkarkiv, en med guider till hur man bloggar, en om mordet på Olof Palme, och så vidare. Den sista är den enda av dem som fortfarande <a href=\"https://palmemordet.se/\">ligger uppe</a>, men dess utseende har uppdaterats flera gånger sedan jag först la upp den 2010. Jag får fortfarande e-postmeddelanden från konspirationsteoretiker några gånger per år. Nästan alla av webbplatserna var byggda med WordPress, vanligtvis med ett gratis- eller premiumtema med mindre modifikationer. Jag fortsatte uppdatera dem efter att jag gick ut gymnasiet, och något år efter min examen fick jag ett jobb på ett litet IT-företag där jag fick betalt för att skriva kod för första gången. Jag såg det fortfarande inte som en möjlig karriärväg. Mitt sikte var inställt på universitetet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_8f7792-b0 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">En karriär byggd på teman</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Två år senare satt jag i min studentlägenhet i Umeå och övervägde att dryga ut hushållsbudgeten genom att bygga premiumteman. Jag hade fritid till övers och inget att förlora, så jag bestämde mig för att ge det ett försök. Mitt första tema var ett enkelt bloggtema vid namn Lasseter, döpt efter den tidigare Pixar-regissören John Lasseter, och jag släppte det på marknadsplatsen Mojo Themes i augusti 2013 för 49 dollar. Jag visste att jag behövde marknadsföra mina premiumteman på något sätt, och jag bestämde mig för att utveckla gratisteman för WordPress.orgs temabibliotek också. Besökare skulle komma till min webbplats för gratisteman och förhoppningsvis bestämma sig för att betala en slant för ett premiumtema istället. Det var planen. Det blev inte riktigt så.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag släppte mitt första gratistema, Lingonberry, samma månad som Lasseter. Trac-ticketen för temat är fortfarande <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/13558\">live</a>, och listan på buggar jag behövde åtgärda innan temat godkändes är en kilometer lång. Carolina Nymark från WordPress.orgs Theme Review Team granskade temat, och hon var väldigt tålmodig. Jag hade inte en aning om hur lite jag visste om temautveckling innan jag skickade in mitt första tema till WordPress.org. Sju år senare var jag och Carolina co-leads för <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwenty/\">Twenty Twenty</a>-standardtemat i WordPress 5.3. Jag är skyldig henne och de andra temagranskarna på WordPress.org väldigt mycket.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/lingonberry-1680x1680-1.jpg\"><img /></a>Lingonberry, mitt första gratis WordPress-tema.\n\n\n\n<p>Det är något speciellt med att se människor ta något som du har skapat och göra något kreativt med det, och när Lingonberry släpptes var det spännande på ett sätt som jag har svårt att sätta ord på. Det fick mig att inse att jag var mycket mer intresserad av att se mina teman bli använda än jag var av att tjäna pengar på dem. Mitt nästa tema, <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/hemingway-wordpress-theme\">Hemingway</a>, var gratis. Det var temat efter det också, och temat efter, och alla teman som följde. Efter något år bestämde jag mig för att sluta sälja Lasseter. Det hade kanske sålts&nbsp; i tio exemplar vid det laget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under samma period hade mina gratisteman laddats ned hundratusentals gånger. Folk började fråga mig om jag kunde göra mindre justeringar av dem mot betalning, och så småningom började jag också få frågor om att bygga nya teman från grunden. När jag hade ett par månader kvar av min utbildning frågade Smashing WordPress-författaren <a href=\"https://tdh.se\">Thord D. Hedengren</a> om jag ville komma ner till Stockholm för en jobbintervju på hans webbyrå: Odd Alice. Efter att ha byggt webbplatser som en hobby i 15 år hade jag nu ett konkret erbjudande om att göra det till min karriär. Jag tog det.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_e569ed-3c wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Välsignelsen och förbannelsen</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Under åren som följde jobbade jag på distans från Umeå i två år innan jag flyttade till Stockholm, separerade från min flickvän, fick vänner för livet och växte både som person och som temautvecklare, fick uppleva en företagssammanslagning och kollapsen av det företaget, och blev frilansare i november 2019 bara månader innan pandemin började. Under hela den tiden fortsatte jag att släppa gratisteman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jag kände mig också vilse. Alla som har fått möjlighet att göra en karriär av deras hobby – och det finns många av oss i WordPress-sfären – vet att det är både en välsignelse och en förbannelse. En välsignelse för att du får ägna dina nio till fem åt något som du verkligen är passionerad för. En förbannelse för att om du jobbar på din passion varje dag så kommer det att leda till att din passion falnar och, i perioder, slocknar helt och hållet. Det är då det är bra att ha en hobby. Trist att du har gjort din hobby till ditt födkrok, eller hur?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pandemin var en vändpunkt för mig, precis som den var för många andra. Jag hade mer och mer börjat känna mig som en WordPress-maskin på två ben, och efter månader av isolering i min etta i Stockholm insåg jag att jag behövde en förändring. Jag behövde något som gav mitt liv en mening som inte renderades med pixlar på en skärm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_170e02-94 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Vandra din egen vandring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fröet såddes i augusti 2019 under en familjesemester i Skottland. Jag, mina föräldrar och mina syskon ägnade två veckor åt att utforska landet med tåg, och vårt första stopp efter Edinburgh var en liten by i de skotska högländerna som heter Fort William. Fort William ligger vid foten av Ben Nevis, Storbritanniens högsta berg, och det är slutpunkten för vandringsleden West Highland Way åt söder och startpunkten för vandringsleden Great Glen Way åt norr. Början av augusti var högsäsong för vandring i området, och Fort William var fyllt av långdistansvandrare som antingen precis hade avslutat sin vandring eller precis skulle påbörja den. Det var något med synen av exalterade vandrare på väg ut i naturen med sina överfulla ryggsäckar som jag inte kunde släppa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>När jag var tillbaka i Sverige såg jag att jag hade blivit tillfrågad om jag ville vara med och designa Twenty Twenty-standardtemat i WordPress 5.3. Jag visste att jag aldrig skulle förlåta mig själv om jag sa nej, så jag svalde alla mina farhågor och sa ja. Månaderna som följde var intensiva. Utöver en hektisk period på jobbet och arbete med Twenty Twenty på kvällar och helger så separerade jag och min flickvän, jag köpte en lägenhet, och jag började övergången från heltidsanställning till livet som frilansare. Jag tittade på vandringsfilmer på YouTube för att slappna av. Jag tittade på mycket vandringsfilmer den hösten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nästa vår, när pandemin hade börjat och samhället stängdes ner, tog jag på mig vandringsryggan för första gången och gav mig ut på min första övernattning i naturen. Trots en tung ryggsäck, ömma muskler och skavsår på helt fel ställen var det kärlek vid första ögonkastet. Ett år efter resan till Skottland gjorde jag min första långvandring i de svenska bergen. Nio dagar på Dag Hammarskjöldsleden från Abisko till Nikkaluokta. Jag var fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/anders-noren-dag-hammarskjoldsleden.jpg\"><img /></a>En av mina tältplatser på Dag Hammarskjöldsleden, mellan Sälka- och Singistugorna.\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_6ae430-01 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Den saknade pusselbiten</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Balans. Det är vad jag förlorade när jag gjorde min hobby till min karriär. När jag var student kunde jag vända mig till sidoprojekt och temautveckling för att få ett kreativt utlopp och en paus från vardagen. När jag började jobba som temautvecklare på heltid försökte jag fortfarande använda mina gratisteman som ett kreativt utlopp, och det fungerade tills det inte fungerade längre. När jag till slut nådde den punkten var jag på gränsen till att bli utbränd och tappa lusten för temautveckling helt och hållet. Jag började ifrågasätta varje vägval jag hade gjort i mitt liv. Jag kanske skulle ha blivit kommunikatör ändå?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingen av oss kan vara hundra procent jobb, hundra procent av tiden. Vi behöver alla hitta något annat än våra jobb att vara passionerade för om vi ska kunna leva balanserade liv. Jag tror att det är extra sant för oss som var haft turen att få bygga en karriär på våra fritidsintressen. För mig visade sig vandring vara den saknade pusselbiten. Jag känner mig utvilad och inspirerad varje gång jag kommer tillbaka från en vandring, och jag är redo att ta mig an både kundjobb och gratisteman med förnyad passion. Ingen hade blivit mer överraskad än mitt tolvåriga jag, med näsan begravd i böcker om C++ och QBasic.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/grona-bandet-map.jpg\"><img /></a>Min planerade rutt på Gröna bandet.</div>\n\n\n<p>Nästa sommar ska jag ge mig ut på mitt största äventyr hittills: en två månader lång vandring genom hela den svenska fjällkedjan, från Grövelsjön i söder till Treriksröset i norr. Drygt 130 mil totalt. Vandringen heter Gröna bandet, och till skillnad från de flesta vandringsleder måste man välja sin egen väg från starten till slutet. En passande metafor för en karriär i WordPress. Hela vandringen kommer att dokumenteras i olidlig detalj på min <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andersnoren1/\">Instagram</a>, om du är nyfiken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Det är ett enormt privilegium att kunna ge sig ut på såna äventyr, och jag skulle sannolikt inte ha haft den möjligheten utan den underliga karriärväg som WordPress-communityt har gett mig. För det är jag oändligt tacksam.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/blessings-and-curses-of-turning-your-hobby-into-a-career/\">Blessings and curses of turning your hobby into a career &#8211; Välsignelser och förbannelser med att förvandla sin hobby till en karriär</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Dec 2022 08:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Anders Norén\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: Google Rolls Out December 2022 “Helpful Content” Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140146\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/google-rolls-out-december-2022-helpful-content-update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3164:\"<p>Google is in the process of rolling out its <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/updates/ranking\">December 2022</a> &#8220;helpful content&#8221; system update, which started on the 5th and is becoming more visible in search results. The company estimates it will take approximately two weeks to fully roll out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The helpful content system generates a signal that is used by Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide\">automated ranking systems</a> to provide people with what it deems to be more original and helpful content &#8220;written by people, for people&#8221; in search results. This particular update improves the system&#8217;s classifier and works across content in all languages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system was designed to reward content where Google determines that visitors have had a satisfying experience and, conversely, where visitors do not find what they are looking for, the content will not perform as well. This is distilled into a site-wide signal where Google&#8217;s systems automatically identify &#8220;content that seems to have little value, low-added value or is otherwise not particularly helpful to those doing searches.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Google finds relatively high amounts of unhelpful content on a site, the rest of the site&#8217;s content is not as likely to perform well in Search. With this application of the system, unhelpful content is like a poison for the rest of the website. Google said removing it could boost the rankings for the rest of the site&#8217;s content. It can take months for Google to reclassify a site&#8217;s content as helpful after unhelpful content has been removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google published more information on how the classifier works and what it means for rankings:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This classifier process is entirely automated, using a machine-learning model. It works globally across all languages. It is not a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9044175\">manual action</a>&nbsp;nor a spam action. Instead, it&#8217;s just one of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/ranking-results/\">many signals Google evaluates</a>&nbsp;to rank content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that some people-first content on sites classified as having unhelpful content could still rank well, if there are other signals identifying that people-first content as helpful and relevant to a query. The signal is also weighted; sites with lots of unhelpful content may notice a stronger effect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first major update to helpful content since August 2022. At that time Google encouraged site owners to focus on creating &#8220;people-first content,&#8221; as opposed to search engine-first content. Site owners are encouraged to reference Google&#8217;s guide to &#8220;<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content\">Creating helpful, reliable, people-first content,</a>&#8221; which includes dozens of questions for evaluating whether content will be deemed helpful or not.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Dec 2022 04:04:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 11.6 Adds Block Pattern Support to Forms\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140131\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-11-6-adds-block-pattern-support-to-forms\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2090:\"<p>Jetpack has introduced a major update to its Form block in the latest version <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/blog/jetpack-11-6-update-to-the-form-block-and-more/\">11.6 release</a>. Users can now interact with the various form templates as patterns. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new quick start placeholder appears anytime users invoke a new form block. It displays a selection of the most commonly used form types as icons. Clicking on any one of the form templates will instantly add it to the block. From there, users can further customize the form fields and labels. It also displays a link to documentation on customizing forms and a link to view and export form responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 11.6 also introduces a patterns explorer, similar to the one found in the block inserter. Here users can see all available patterns fully expanded to better inform their decisions during the form creation process.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>After testing, I found the pattern explorer to be a somewhat clunky way to view available form templates. In the default view they appear one at a time and expand to fit the explorer&#8217;s viewport. They are also difficult to scroll. Clicking on the grid style view, the patterns are easier to see but the design could be improved to better differentiate each pattern, as they all seem to run right into the next with faint borders around each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I&#8217;m eager to see Jetpack iterate on the execution of these new ways to build forms, the placeholder and pattern explorer undoubtedly help users get started faster than trying to build a form from scratch in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable updates in this release include SEO improvements that allow users to have more granular control over how their content is presented (or not presented) to search engines. In the Jetpack SEO panel, users can now exclude that specific post or page from being indexed, while allowing the content to remain publicly accessible. Users can also now set a custom SEO title for posts and pages that will show in the search snippet and browser tab.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Dec 2022 02:13:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Do The Woo Community: A Product Builders Journey with Eran Shor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73747\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://dothewoo.io/a-product-builders-journey-with-eran-shor/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:408:\"<p>Eran has a history with both WooCommerce and WordPress and shares his story on building Zorem and his latest product, TrackShip.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/a-product-builders-journey-with-eran-shor/\">A Product Builders Journey with Eran Shor</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Dec 2022 10:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: ChatGPT Creates a Working WordPress Plugin – On the First Try\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140097\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/chatgpt-creates-a-working-wordpress-plugin-on-the-first-try\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3742:\"<p>ChatGPT <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1599668808285028353\">passed 1 million users</a> today and Twitter is brimming with a steady stream of creative questions and applications for the AI-powered chatbot. The language model, <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/\">created by OpenAI</a>, is powered by GPT-3.5, a series of models trained on text and code from before Q4 2021.

WordPress developer Johnathon Williams brought this close to home when he asked ChatGPT to spin up a WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ordinarily, plugin creation is a task that requires a certain level of technical proficiency.

It was founded by Sé Reed, Katie Adams Farrell, and Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organization was created to address some of the challenges of contribution, where larger companies tend to have more resources to sponsor contributors, while individuals and smaller companies may struggle to balance their ability to volunteer with the need to make ends meet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the primary ways the WPCC aims to support contributors is through Fellowships. This is an agreement where individuals receive financial support for their contributions to WordPress with global pay parity. They will also engage in professional development and are encouraged to participate in regional WordCamps as attendees, speakers, and/or organizers with expenses covered by the fellowship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fellowships are an interesting concept, designed to incubate high quality contributors who are connected to the community with a well-rounded set of expectations that are not narrowly limited to the code produced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCC aims to identify areas where the community is underrepresented or contribution is needed and fund Fellowships in those areas. The first fellowship they plan to fund is for <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/thewpcc/contribute/accessibility-fellowship-46812\">an Accessibility contributor</a>, who will dedicate 5-10 hours a week to work on the Make WordPress Accessibility Team and its existing accessibility initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Accessibility Fellowship will be a bit of a test, in terms of fundraising and response from the community,&#8221; WPCC co-founder Sé Reed said. &#8220;Accessibility is an easy place to start because the community already knows it is important and we have contributors who are doing crucial work without any monetary support.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCC is using Open Collective as the fiscal sponsor for its 501(c)3 status, enabling donations to be classified as charitable giving, which is in many cases tax-deductible. All transactions that run through the organization are transparent and publicly documented on the organization&#8217;s <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/thewpcc/transactions\">transactions page</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reed said the tipping point for her team to get organized to make this happen was a tweet from Matt Mullenweg shortly after the 2022 WordCamp US, where he responded to people calling for users of assistive technology to be paid for testing Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\'m not opposed to paying people for labor or people getting paid for their labor. It\'s just not something that <a href=\"https://t.co/0IkxYEeLJd\">https://t.co/0IkxYEeLJd</a> or the WordPress Foundation are set up to do, nor will they be in the future. Individuals have sponsored paid user tests before, just directly.</p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1568789183413776385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 11, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;His statement in that tweet really made two things clear to me,&#8221; Reed said. &#8220;One, that this funding concept would not be in conflict with the work of the WordPress Foundation or the official project, and two, that if we wanted something like this to happen it would have to be done as an independent entity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WPCC founders joined in on a recent WPwatercooler podcast episode where they shared their contributor stories and why they started the organization. One of their commonalities was a sincere desire to contribute more but not enough time in the day. With very few sponsored contributor positions available, volunteering is not always possible, resulting in the project being led primarily by sponsored contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We hope that the WP Community Collective can help bridge the gap between the passion people feel for WordPress, and the very real and practical limits of volunteer contribution,” Reed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCC is starting out with a small governance team that consists of the three co-founders but plans to expand the organizational structure to include more community representation, including an Advisory Board with a permanent seat for the Executive Director of WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People who want to support the WPCC can join with an <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/thewpcc/contribute/individual-membership-47231\">individual membership</a> for free to stay up to date with the organization&#8217;s activities.

The claim is being managed by law firms Humphries Kerstetter and Geradin Partners, who allege that &#8220;Google abused its dominant position in the market for online advertising, earning super-profits for itself at the expense of the tens of thousands of publishers of websites and mobile apps in the UK.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The firms&#8217; economic analysis of Google’s alleged anti-competitive behavior suggests that some companies may have had advertising revenues reduced by 40%. Although Google has been the subject of multiple regulatory investigations in the EU, UK, and USA, resulting in a €220m fine from French competition authorities, this claim aims to compensate publishers and recover losses through a competition class action lawsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.humphrieskerstetter.com/category/news/\">statement</a> published by Humphries Kerstetter details the focus of their investigations:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>These competition investigations all focus on the same core facts. Google dominates the markets for ad tech services in the UK and across the world controlling up to 90% of the market in certain sectors. This allows Google to dictate terms, control pricing and, in some scenarios, enables it to favour its own platforms in the process by which advertisements are selected to be published.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The allegations of the competition claim are similar to the complaint brought by the US Department of Justice that alleges <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/amp-has-irreparably-damaged-publishers-trust-in-google-led-initiatives\">Google used AMP to impede header bidding and throttle the load time of non-AMP ads</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The marketplace for online advertising is sophisticated, technical and highly automated,&#8221; Claudio Pollack, who is heading the UK publishers&#8217; competition claim, said. &#8220;Advertising is sold in a fraction of a second in a process which is designed to match the product being advertised with the profile of an individual visiting a website. Third party platforms operate on both sides of the marketplace matching supply with demand and – in an ideal world – ensuring the market operates efficiently and effectively. Unfortunately, it is now well established that this market has developed in a way that is primarily serving Google.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A separate multi-billion Euro claim will be running in parallel in the EU, handled by a Dutch law firm in cooperation with Geradin Partners. They are seeking compensation for the alleged damage to small, local publishers who have struggled to stay afloat amid decreased advertising revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While the value of the claim we are bringing is substantial, we believe this matter is about much more than money,&#8221; Geradin Partners founding partner Professor Geradin said. &#8220;For years Google has been denying companies in the UK and Europe and beyond, including the local press and the publishers of community focused websites, the chance to earn a proper income by way of advertising. As well as bringing Google to account the parties who have lost out need proper compensation, something a CAT claim can achieve at no cost to those parties.”</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Dec 2022 22:54:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"Post Status: All the Things This Week\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=145392\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://poststatus.com/all-the-things-this-week/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4995:\"<h2 id=\"h-state-of-the-word\">State of the Word</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the second year, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/state-of-the-word-2022/\">State of the Word</a> (SOTW) will be a small in-person event at the Tumblr offices in New York City on the afternoon of December 15 (1pm local time).

Along with the benefits it will bring for WordPress users and contractors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step for establishing such a credential is twofold: having a team begin working on a standardized exam for becoming credentialed, and gathering letters of endorsement from those hiring in WordPress and for WordPress roles within the community.

This annual survey helps project leaders and contributors learn more about how and why the software is being used. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year&#8217;s survey is available in the seven most frequently installed languages based on the number of WordPress downloads, including <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/fr-2022\">French</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/de-2022\">German</a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/it-2022\">Italian</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/jp-2022\">Japanese</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/ru-2022\">Russian</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/es-2022\">Spanish</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey begins with some questions about basic demographics and moves on to a mix of interesting questions that fall more under the topic of market research than previous years. It asks why you use WordPress instead of other tools/platforms, what you think are the most essential three plugins when building sites, and what are the best and most frustrating things about WordPress. The survey also asks whether respondents have used blocks in the new Site Editor and which Site Editor they prefer. It will be interesting to see the data from these questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last eight questions are for contributors, and even with those it takes less than five minutes to complete. Although some information from the 2022 survey may be shared in the annual State of the Word address, the survey will be open through the end of 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analysis from the 2021 survey results will be shared in early 2023 and WordPress will publish the 2022 results sometime next year.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Dec 2022 04:28:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"WPTavern: Two New WordPress Plugins Improve Block Editor Accessibility and WCAG Compliance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=140002\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/two-new-wordpress-plugins-improve-block-editor-accessibility-and-wcag-compliance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2988:\"<p>WordPress Core Committer Jb Audras, CTO of the France-based <a href=\"https://www.whodunit.fr/\">Whodunit</a> agency, has released two new accessibility plugins in cooperation with Guillaume Turpin, another developer on the Whodunit team.

Key takeaways and trends that emerge from this survey often find their way into the annual <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/state-of-the-word-2022/\">State of the Word</a> address, are shared in the public project blogs, and can influence the direction and strategy for the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Simply put: this survey helps those who build WordPress understand more about how the software is used, and by whom. The survey also helps leaders in the WordPress open source project learn more about our contributors’ experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure that your WordPress experience is represented in the 2022 survey results, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/en-2022\">take the 2022 annual survey now.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/en-2022\">Take the 2022 Survey (English)</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also take the survey in <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/fr-2022\">French</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/de-2022\">German</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/it-2022\">Italian</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/jp-2022\">Japanese</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/ru-2022\">Russian</a>, or <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.survey.fm/es-2022\">Spanish</a>, thanks to the efforts of WordPress polyglot contributors. These are the most frequently installed languages based on the number of WordPress downloads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey will be open through the end of 2022, and then WordPress plans to publish the results sometime in 2023. This year, the survey questions have been refreshed for more effortless survey flow, completion, and analysis. Some questions have been removed, while a few new ones are now present, reflecting the present and future of WordPress. If you’re looking for the analysis of the 2021 survey results, those will also be shared in early 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spread the word</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help spread the word about the survey by sharing it with your network, through Slack, or within your social media accounts. The more people who complete the survey and share their experience with WordPress, the more the project as a whole will benefit in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Security and privacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Data security and privacy are paramount to the WordPress project and community. With this in mind, all data will be anonymized: no email addresses nor IP addresses will be associated with published results.

The plugin is based on Elasticsearch and is used by customers of the ElasticPress.io service (a SaaS solution), as well as those who are hosting their own Elasticsearch instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update adds a new &#8220;Status Report&#8221; page in the dashboard with information that can be helpful for troubleshooting ElasticPress and synced content. The UI uses Gutenberg components for the collapsible sections. Version 4.4.0 introduces a new query logger functionality that stores failed queries (up to 5 in the last 24 hours) and displays an admin notice if failed queries are detected. The failed queries are displayed on the new Status Report page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Another highlight of this release is the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/pull/2959\">customize the template for Instant Results</a>. It gives developers a JavaScript hook for replacing the component used to render search results in Instant Results. The Instant Results feature <a href=\"https://www.elasticpress.io/blog/2022/03/introducing-instant-results-wordpress-fastest-search-ever/\">was introduced in March</a> with limited customization capabilities. It added a new search modal over the page content that inherits the site&#8217;s styles. Developers could adjust the appearance and expose facets, but this new update gives them control over the whole template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another small but useful update in this release is the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/ElasticPress/pull/3100\">exclude a specific post from Search</a>. This helps site owners further customize the search experience to deliver only the intended results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers who are using the plugin should take note of the announcement included in this release regarding the migration of the Users feature to the ElasticPress Labs plugin, which houses more experimental features:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Note that starting from the ElasticPress 5.0.0 release the <code>Users</code> feature will be moved to the <a href=\"https://github.com/10up/ElasticPressLabs\">ElasticPress Labs</a> plugin.

Yesterday the final releases for these versions (3.7.41, 3.8.41, 3.9.40, and 4.0.38) were made available to the very small percentage of users who are running ancient versions of WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the final releases, the upgrade notification now informs users that they are on a version that is no longer receiving security updates. This affects fewer than 1% of total installs.

He is part of the team helping to make the first WordCamp Asia a success in 2023.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The People of WordPress series shares some of the inspiring stories of how people&#8217;s lives can change for the better through WordPress and its global network of contributors.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1014\" height=\"627\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-featured-img.jpg?resize=1014%2C627&ssl=1\" alt=\"Huanyi pictured sitting inside a rock formation.\" class=\"wp-image-13479\" />\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Discovering WordPress and the benefit of child themes </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Huanyi’s first footsteps in WordPress began in 2017 when he worked for a firm that built blogs and developed ad content for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After building a few sites using the platform, he discovered child themes and through them opened up a world of possibilities for his clients. To this day, he uses child themes to deliver truly custom designs and functionality for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in his career, Huanyi moved into digital marketing, integrating sites with massive ad platforms like Google and Facebook. This led him to learn to work with tracking code and JavaScript. He also began his learning journey in HTML, CSS, and PHP, to be able to improve his development skills and customize child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meetups bring together software users to learn together</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-1.jpg?fit=600%2C800&ssl=1\" alt=\"Huanyi and a koala.\" class=\"wp-image-13476\" /><em>Huanyi pictured in Australia during one of his travels meeting a koala bear.</em>\n\n\n\n<p>When Huanyi had a problem with a client&#8217;s site, he looked to WordPress meetups near where he lived in <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Taipei-WordPress/\">Taipei</a> to help find the solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>“When I encountered an issue with the custom archive pages, a local meetup announcement showed up on my WordPress dashboard</strong>.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Huanyi Chuang</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At the meetup, he met more experienced WordPress users and developers there, who answered his questions and helped him learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I encountered an issue with the custom archive pages, a local meetup announcement showed up on my WordPress dashboard. That was my original connection with the local community,” Huanyi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress community gave Huanyi a chance to connect with people, feed his curiosity about the software, and join a circle of people he could share this interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, he thought meetups were an opportunity to source new clients, and he took his business cards to every event. However, he soon found that these events offered him the opportunity to make friends and share knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From then on, Huanyi started focusing more on what he could give to these events and networks, making new friends, and listening to people. This led him to share as a meetup speaker his own commercial website management experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The road to WordCamp</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was going to his first meetup and then getting involved with WordCamps that changed Huanyi&#8217;s whole relationship with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-2.jpg?resize=600%2C800&ssl=1\" alt=\"Huanyi pictured on an outing, stood next to a white car.\" class=\"wp-image-13477\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, he took the step to help as an organizer, having joined the Taoyuan Meetup in Taiwan. He played several parts across the organizing team, and the welcoming feeling he got in every situation encouraged him to get more involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recalls meeting new friends from different fields and other countries, which gave him a great sense of achievement and strengthened his passion for participating in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the team started this meetup, numbers were much lower than in the group in the city of Taipei, but they were not disheartened and gradually grew the local WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They created a pattern of ‘multiple organizers,’ which spread the workload and grew friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><strong>“Being connected to and from meetups is the most valuable part of the community. Having these friends makes me gather more information. We share information and benefit from others’ information, and thus we gain more trust in each other. With such credibility, we share more deeply and build deeper relations.”</strong> </p>\n<cite>Huanyi Chuang</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the pandemic, the meetup met every month and grew to become the second largest meetup in Taiwan. Huanyi also contributed to the WordPress community as an organizer of WordCamp Taipei 2018 in the speaker team and lead organizer of <a href=\"https://taiwan.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Taiwan 2021</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>So why should you join the community?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Huanyi, you will always have something to take home with you. It might be new information or experiences. It might be plugins or theme ideas. But most of all, it is the chance to meet fascinating people and make new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Huanyi’s message to other contributors:<br />&#8220;Keep participating, and you will find more you can achieve than you expect.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that long-term participation will &#8216;let you feel the humanity behind the project&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Localize: the road ahead for WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/huanyi-3.jpg?resize=900%2C675&ssl=1\" alt=\"Huanyi standing on a sandy beach.\" class=\"wp-image-13478\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Huanyi believes WordPress has the power to break down the barriers between designers, project managers, developers, marketers, writers, and publishers. In Taiwan, he said WordPress is &#8216;a common protocol&#8217; that lets people from all of these disciplines work and communicate together more easily than they ever have before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why he works on and encourages others to localize plugins today. He believes localization of the software is the foundation for the extension of the WordPress community as it enables people to ‘Flex their Freedom’ in a language they speak!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has helped to organize online events around previous <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation Day</a> events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huanyi said: “I think it&#8217;s important to localize WordPress because its very concept of ‘open source’ means that people can access it freely. In another way, free from the monopoly of knowledge and speech. To achieve it, it&#8217;s important that people can access it with their own language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Localization is the foundation of the extension of WordPress community because it helps people using different languages to access the project and lowers the hurdle to understand how things work.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Contributors</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/no249a002/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>no249a002</a> for sharing his adventures in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>marybaum</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>), Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>), Adeeb Malik (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/adeebmalik/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>adeebmalik</a>) for research, interviews, and contributing to this feature article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>People of WordPress</em> series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, the thoughts on the past present and future of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or by going to wptavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players. If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to wptavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Matt Medeiros. Matt is the driving force behind many WordPress initiatives. That could be the creation of plugins, WordPress news, media, as well as podcasts about all manner of WordPress specific subjects. He likes to juggle multiple projects at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently he&#8217;s the director of podcaster to success at Castos, which is a podcast hosting company with a WordPress plugin. He&#8217;s on the podcast today to give us his take on the past, present and future of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many millions of people like to work with the WordPress software, they create websites, plugins, and themes, and extend what the CMS can do. Others, such as Matt like to ponder the broader purpose and direction of the software and the community around it. The Matt Report and The WP Minute have enabled us to hear about what the community is doing, what it wants and where its points of friction are. He&#8217;s talked to hundreds of people about what WordPress was, is, and might be. And so he&#8217;s in a unique position to pontificate about what WordPress, beyond the software, is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with mats backstory. How he found WordPress and why he started to use it. We talk about how he&#8217;s dipped in and out of the community over the years. More excited at times, less so at others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation moves on to some of the trends that Matt has noticed. He identifies how the software and the wider community have altered over time. We talk about how The WP Minute got started, and how he&#8217;s building up a community of like-minded people to consume as well as to create the content that they&#8217;re putting out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we get into the governance of WordPress and the future of the project more generally. There are certainly things that Matt likes, but there are some wrinkles which get aired as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We finish up by talking about podcasts and Matt&#8217;s work with Castos and how they are trying to make it easier to get your voice out there, especially with their WordPress integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a lovely chat with a thoughtful and far sighted member of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more. You can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Matt Medeiros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Matt Medeiros. Hello, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:10] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Nathan, thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are so welcome. If you&#8217;ve been in the WordPress space for, I&#8217;m going to say a decade or more, it&#8217;s very likely that you&#8217;ve heard about Matt Medeiros, but just in case you haven&#8217;t, I&#8217;m going to let Matt do a little bit of an intro to give us his backstory about WordPress, the WordPress space, the projects he&#8217;s been involved in. So, Matt, off you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Well, my newsletter list says otherwise. So, there&#8217;s still plenty of people who need to know me. So Matt Medeiros. I&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff, 10, 15 years. I don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s been. Started a podcast called Matt Report back when I started a digital agency. That&#8217;s how I built the digital agency. Ran Matt Report for many, many, many, many years still out there, and now have pivoted this focus on thewpminute.com, which is five minutes of WordPress news every week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress space, agency stuff, plugin stuff, theme stuff, podcasting stuff, YouTube stuff. And now I am the director of podcaster success at castos.com, which is a podcast hosting company, which also has a WordPress plugin. And also the parent company of wordpress.com, Automattic, has invested in Castos a little over a year ago at this point. So it&#8217;s podcasting and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;ll definitely get into that. I confess I had forgotten that fact. Cast your mind back. Let&#8217;s say it&#8217;s 12 years ago, something like that. What was the thing that made it WordPress as opposed to something else all those years ago? Could have been Drupal, could have been Joomla, could have been Expression Engine. Why WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:40] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> In fact, it was Drupal, to begin with. That was my first foray into really taking an open source CMS seriously, besides PHP-Nuke, which I had played with, before Drupal. But Drupal came into my professional career as I was head of web services for an ISP, internet service provider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We used to do things like dial up, ISDN, if you can remember those. T1 lines. And we purchased another ISP that had a web development arm and it was a Drupal shop. And this is around Drupal four and five, around those versions. And the head of design or the head designer at the time, he was like, hey Matt, because we were taking over and other people were leaving and I was going to steer the ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s like, I want to get away from Drupal. It is so hard to design on top of. Now you got to remember this is, I don&#8217;t know, 15 years ago, something like that. And he said, there&#8217;s this thing called WordPress. I can really design on top of that. I can do really well with it. I want to try it out. And that was the first theme we bought was the theme called Standard, which was a collaboration way back in the day between John Saddington, Tom McFarlin, and Eric Dye, I believe was his last name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the first theme I ever purchased, in a professional setting. We use that to build themes and do that with our customers. And, and that was the entrance into WordPress. And once I broke off from that company, I just took all that knowledge and started my digital agency with that. And it was domino effect, ever since in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:08] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve really had a, like a broad, rich, encounter with WordPress though, because for me at least, anyway, it was WordPress websites and then more recently got into podcasting and those are basically the two things that I&#8217;ve done. But, as we&#8217;ll probably find out during the course of the show, you&#8217;ve really dotted around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I want to raise right at the beginning, and I don&#8217;t know what your thoughts on this are. It&#8217;s a bit of an abstract thought. If we were to rewind the clock, say 20 years ago. Both of us have obviously decided at some point, I think the internet is quite an interesting and fun thing. But I genuinely had no idea, it could have been a flash in the pan. Maybe it would&#8217;ve represented a tiny sliver of what people were doing. Shops, brick and mortar shops would still be thriving. Websites would&#8217;ve been really tangential, hardly anybody might have visited them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was no conception that the phone would become a conduit. That you would carry something around in your back pocket. That computers would be basically portable. None of that was a thought, and yet both of us staked more or less everything on it, which with a bit of hindsight was probably the best decision we ever made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you can talk to computers that sit in a tiny box in your kitchen and it will give you coherent answers to everything. Do you feel like you&#8217;re a very privileged person to have stepped into the broader internet and all that that offers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> My genesis around getting into this space, if you want to go even deeper into the rabbit hole of who Matt Medeiros is, is my family ran a string of car dealerships for about 45 years in my local, my local area. We weren&#8217;t like this big massive conglomerate auto dealership. We just had two, family owned and operated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the technology that was moving, fast paced in that world. Consumer internet being born, websites, you know, this all sounds pretty trivial, but back then it was like, oh wow, we can post a car on the internet and somebody can look at it and email us, or most likely call us back then and buy it? Speaking of the privilege that, like being in that space, having a family that ran this dealership, but because I was the youngest one and I was into it. I was the one that put all the technology together, from General Motors, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were literally talking to an 17, 18 year old at the time, as the head of the internet department. Because I was the only one who got it, who understood it. My dad did, but you know, I sort of led the charge on that. And, I remember being in college and, you know, when you look at WordPress and open source, one of my, uh, capstone courses was to build something with, I forget what the terms were, but they said build it with multiple packages. And back then I was learning like Linux and Novell and, and Windows NT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I remember building PHP-Nuke with a bulletin board with, a blog roll. And I was building a car site, and I was like, wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if somebody could go to this website and book an oil change for their car by filling out this form. And then if you had questions about repairing your car, you could come to this thing called a bulletin board, and have like this little community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I was doing back then was doing everything that social, that we all take for granted these days with the advancement of technology. And I was like wiring it together with little open source packages. So yeah, roundabout way of getting to, yeah, I feel pretty lucky to fall into that space at an early age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I feel that you and I hit a time when you could flip from just having any kind of job into working on the internet, because the barrier to entry in terms of knowledge was so low. You basically had to learn HTML and then along came CSS, it was straightforward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the promise now is much more difficult. I can&#8217;t really imagine what it must be like for somebody at the age of 17 or 18. The things that they must need to learn in order to become employable. Speaking of the internet, you mentioned social media and what have you. I wonder what your thoughts are on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that we&#8217;re straying away a little bit from WordPress, but it does touch on GPL and it does touch on the broader purpose of the internet. What are your feelings about how the internet has evolved over the last, let&#8217;s say seven, eight years? Things like Facebook, social media, and the associated benefits and harms that go with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:25] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> I don&#8217;t think humans were ready to be wired up emotionally, to the level that we&#8217;re at these days. Spanning across many, many contexts, right? From your everyday life of sharing pictures of what you&#8217;re eating, what your kids are doing, to more serious things like health, wellness, mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Couple weeks ago suddenly lost my father-in-law and like the grieving factor of online. And you really start to sit back and say like, what, what is this? Like why? Is this value, all of us connected like this? Are we really together in this? Or is it just this digital connection that sort of literally just disappears as the feed refreshes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it really starts to have you question all of these things. Now there&#8217;s definitely many, many benefits. I mean, friends, that I&#8217;ve made through social, the businesses that I&#8217;ve built, and continue to build. There&#8217;s definitely a plus factor, but there&#8217;s a huge negative and, and things that I don&#8217;t think human beings are really ready for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I look at it in two different ways. One, I have three very young sons, three boys, under the ages of six. And I&#8217;m just like mentally preparing on how to onboard them to the internet, how I will do that. But I also see things from the broader perspective, is you and I are content creators. We&#8217;re just playing in the WordPress world mostly and softwares and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I see people who are whatever, they&#8217;re into fashion, they&#8217;re into tech, they&#8217;re into video games, and there&#8217;s a burnout factor. There&#8217;s a, I must continue to create all of this content to please these people who really don&#8217;t care about me, factor. And then there&#8217;s those who really become hits, they do really well. And they&#8217;re not ready for that fame and that spotlight, because they&#8217;re one person with a million YouTube subscribers in their home office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;re not ready for what that&#8217;s like, to have all of these humans watching them and asking them for things. And it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s not a mindset that I think we&#8217;re all really ready for, without some education. But we&#8217;re so early that, 50 years from now, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s probably not going to be a thing, because we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re still cresting the analog to the digital. Like you said, the young folks, how are they going to get jobs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the, the issue is, is they lose the fundamentals of building technology. When I was learning how to build a website, I was learning how to build a computer. So I knew that there was a CPU and memory and a hard disc, and these things were storing this content and yada, all that fun stuff. Now, with the introduction of whatever, let&#8217;s say, easy web website builders and you just talk to AI and it codes a website for you. There are going to be this swath of people who just don&#8217;t know where all of this stuff lives and how it&#8217;s all connected. So, that was a deep rabbit hole that I just went down, and I hope we tumbled around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, really interesting. You mentioned your three children and I think that&#8217;s really fascinating for me. I have children as well, and one of the things that I struggle with. On the one hand, I&#8217;m really a proponent of technology. I love it. There&#8217;s almost nothing about it that I don&#8217;t love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet at the same time, I&#8217;ve noticed that my children have been born into an era in which technology could be literally welded to your hand and, you know, there&#8217;s no escape from it. And so the notifications can come in at all times of day, and night. Stress there on night, so it disrupts things. Like it disrupts the normal cycle of interpersonal relations in a room because, there&#8217;s a bing bong on a phone and suddenly you&#8217;re distracted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the reason for being in the room with other people is somewhat shattered. And then, you hear about people who leave their phones by their bedsides and the phone goes off in the middle of the night and it disrupts their sleep, and all of these impacts. And whilst I am boldly a proponent of the internet, there are aspects of it which trouble me. And I think your wise point there, right at the end was that we&#8217;re young to this. We&#8217;re 20 years in, maybe a little bit more, but let&#8217;s say roughly 20 years in. And so we don&#8217;t really know where this is going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s kind of like steering a ship. I&#8217;m imagining somebody in 1492, Christopher Columbus or somebody on a ship, you know, they&#8217;ve set sail. They know they&#8217;ve got a destination, but they don&#8217;t know how long it&#8217;s going to be or when they&#8217;re going to get there. This feels to me like the internet. And I do wonder if some of these things that we may regard as bad habits at the moment will get washed away and replaced, hopefully with more beneficial things. I&#8217;m optimistic about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:52] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Yeah, I agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just turn to the WordPress space, generally speaking. So you&#8217;ve been in it for a long time. Certainly much longer than I have. And you&#8217;ve been somebody that&#8217;s been observing the WordPress space. Not just using the software, but considering it, considering the impact of it, considering the business that can be made around it, and looking at the plugins and the themes and all of that, and having a critical eye on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very broad question, but I&#8217;m going to ask it anyway. What have you noticed as the main changes over time? Young people to the community, you&#8217;ve been in the community using WordPress for a couple of years. They won&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s been any changes. The software&#8217;s just the software, but there&#8217;s been a lot. What do you think the main things have been for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:29] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m going to try to summarize this as quickly as possible that we can break off into different paths that I think are, are relevant. But there was certainly a long span of the same folks doing the same WordCamp talks, I&#8217;m not saying this in a bad way, but there was, I don&#8217;t know, a 10 year cohort of WordPress that I felt, we were all jiving and doing the same thing, showing up to the WordCamps, and everyone knew each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real pivotal milestone, for better or worse, was the introduction of Gutenberg, and the software and how it was introduced and all that stuff. Those pages in the history books have already been written. I think it was at that point where a certain segment of the community was one, they were like, I don&#8217;t want this in WordPress, so I&#8217;m done. There was another segment where, we don&#8217;t know how to code around this, and I don&#8217;t want this coding overhead. And then there was a third, in my view, where a lot of people used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excuse might be the wrong word, but it was certainly a time where, man, you&#8217;re 10 or whatever it was, 10 or 12 years into software. That&#8217;s a lifetime of using the same shiny tool. And there&#8217;s just this natural thing, I think, of all of us who are like technologists or like 10, 12 years in, ah, I just got to try something else. And that was a moment, two thirds of these people are leaving because of these reasons. I guess I&#8217;ll leave too, and go find another shiny object.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where I guess the no code market really stepped in. Not saying because of WordPress, but it was certainly a right time, right place, kind of thing where those tools were getting shinier and better, and it was a great moment for them to somebody else to be like, ah, Webflow, ah, Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, Coda, Notion, all these things that we&#8217;re just like piecing together like we did with WordPress 10 years ago. Now we can do this again here with these shiny, faster free tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the way that I see it. That change in the community over the milestone of Gutenberg, and up until now there&#8217;s a lot of fresh faces in here, which is great. But there&#8217;s less of this, I don&#8217;t know, warm blanket around all of us these days, that used to be there, for a good 10 year cohort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons why I started The Matt Report at the time was, one, it&#8217;s because I wasn&#8217;t a developer and I didn&#8217;t know anyone. I didn&#8217;t know how to talk to developers, so I said, well, I&#8217;ll just interview them and, and promote them so that they can get jobs and maybe I&#8217;ll learn more people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But two, when I was at one of my first WordCamps, perfect example, there was, you know, one of the core contributors of WordPress and he would walk by and people like, Oh, I really want to talk to him. I&#8217;m afraid to talk to him. So there was like this celebrity status kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s when it hit me like, oh, people really care about these other people in the community. Let me go and find them and interview them, and prop them up so other people can meet them instead of being, you know, shy or worried to talk about them at a WordCamp. So I think the biggest change, for me anyway, has been the community in the involvement of everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Did I get a sense, I could be wrong. Forgive me if I got this sense and my spidey sense was tingling in the wrong direction. But, I kind of got a feeling about three or four years ago that you, you kinda fell out of love a little bit with WordPress and were seeking paths new. But then you&#8217;ve drifted back in, drift is the wrong word, you&#8217;ve come back in with great aplomb, you know, you&#8217;re back in making all the content and what have you. Is that true? Did you find yourself in that miasma, thinking I don&#8217;t really know whether I belong anymore?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:55] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Picture us in the, in my therapist office, and you&#8217;re sitting across from me with your pen and notepad. There&#8217;s a lot of things that go into that feeling. You&#8217;re not totally wrong. But, as you know as a content creator, you continue to create all the content. And quite literally, I burned out on the YouTube stuff because it was just a hard slog on the Plugin Tut channel. But then it was, how do I really grow this? How do I grow this podcast and, bring in other, other voices? Because the same thing I just mentioned about this 10 year cohort, all the same people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could feel those effects on the content that I was doing. That&#8217;s when I started to introduce the no code, maybe the more business aspect, SaaS developers, stuff like that, and bringing that into the fold. It certainly, my love for WordPress, it actually goes much deeper than the software. I think that WordPress itself is, speaking of like jobs and education. This is a tool that can empower individuals, local organizations, states, towns, to put people into a workforce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress is, I think, a great learning tool. A great building tool to do all that stuff, aside from the fun web stuff that we can do with it. So you&#8217;re not too far off, but there was sort of a reshaping of how do I introduce new voices? Because I could feel probably just like you, the social media, the engagement of everyone sort of just getting burned out from the same old thing in WordPress, and that was probably me shifting the way I do content at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So shifting more recently, your content creation, it&#8217;s not entirely this, but you&#8217;ve moved to a new moniker. You&#8217;ve got The WP Minute. Just give us a bit of an insight into what the intention was there and how it&#8217;s going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:46] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> We can thank our mutual friend Davinder Singh Kainth for getting me into this, uh, yet another content rabbit hole. But I also thank him very much for pushing me in this direction. I had an idea that I pitched to him one day and I was like, hey, probably just like your spidey sense went off. I&#8217;ve gotten really busy with the Castos day job, three young boys. It&#8217;s like, how the heck can I even do long form content anymore?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I wanted to do short form content and I approached Davinder and I said, hey, what I&#8217;d really like to do is a spoken version of your, of your newsletter. Fast forward, to make a long story short, he just said, how about you just start your own and I&#8217;ll just support you and I said, I don&#8217;t really want to do my own, I just want to, just want to piggyback off of somebody else. And that&#8217;s how we, we got into The WP Minute. So it&#8217;s your favorite five minutes of WordPress news, every Wednesday. But it&#8217;s really grown, to, uh, a small but mighty community. Just introduced Erik Karkovack, who is a top WP Tavern commenter, as the head editor or the editor of The WP Minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he&#8217;s working for me, air quotes, full time as the editor of putting together all the news, curating the news. And then I read the news, every Wednesday, and it&#8217;s just a short five minutes, so you&#8217;re busy, you&#8217;re a busy WordPress professional, you don&#8217;t have the time. We get all the top headlines for you and summarize it for you. And we have a fun community. So if you&#8217;re into the news, I, I certainly recommend The WP Minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:10] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do you decide what stays in and what&#8217;s goes out? I face this problem. I have to decide which podcast episode I&#8217;m going to make, but it&#8217;s much more straightforward because the stuff that I&#8217;m producing content on, probably won&#8217;t matter whether it&#8217;s next week or the week after, it&#8217;s less critical. But for you, you&#8217;ve really got one shot and you&#8217;ve got to presumably try and get all the good bits in in five minutes. That&#8217;s hard, because in the WordPress community, as you know, I can talk about it for at least an hour and a half every week. How do you decide what stays in and what gets cut onto the floor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:41] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Yeah, so I look at the WP Minute as probably the best thing that I&#8217;m ever going to create for WordPress, right? So Matt Report, all the plugins, themes, services, consultations I&#8217;ve done, I feel like the WP Minute is the best thing that I&#8217;m going to contribute to this community. As far as I can see, and I look at it as community driven journalism without, self-promotion on this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is if you really want to have a hand in the news, you could join the membership and be part of this, and you join the membership to support it, because it costs money. And I try to be as transparent as possible of, there&#8217;s hosting, there&#8217;s podcast hosting, there&#8217;s paying Eric, there&#8217;s paying Raquel, there&#8217;s paying Pat to run this team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea is if you want to get the stories out, you join us for short money to support the whole cause. And what I call the members, they call them producers. So you, the community member, can help produce the show. And as you know, Nathan, you get people knocking on your door to promote their product, promote their thing, and it&#8217;s like, hey, great, put your money where your mouth is and if you want your news to be heard, submit it to, what we call the link squad at The WP Minute. It&#8217;s a member curation. So you have the editorial team, myself, Eric, Pat, Raquel, and then you have the members who contribute the news. We all watch the news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I got some Slack bots wired up. We get all the hot topics pumped right into the Slack channel so we can all collaborate on it. But then everyone sort of gets to have a vote. So people who put in their links, if their link makes it to the news, then they all get a credit thank you, both in the newsletter and the podcast. Now the idea is it&#8217;s supposed to be a five minute show. So if there&#8217;s a ton of news and somebody has voted for their top 10 slider plugins for October, chances are that one&#8217;s not going to make it. But we&#8217;ve had some times where we&#8217;ll cut a story from make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, we&#8217;ve got WordPress 6.1 release candidate one is ready. Please test it. Those are things that we always include to raise awareness, but if there&#8217;s acquisition news, community news, Tumblr News, like things that are really big and impactful, those things might drop because those things happen a lot more. So that&#8217;s not the most educated answer of how we select the news, but it is a community effort, and then within the confines of, hey look, this is also short form, so we try to keep it to five to seven minutes every week. People have said to me, why isn&#8217;t it called The WP Minutes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;ve been doing this like you said, for such a long time, and so you&#8217;ve been inspecting the community and what have you. You&#8217;ve got this media channel now, WP Minute, I know you&#8217;re doing a bunch of other stuff, and we&#8217;ll get onto that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you noticed over the last 10, 12, 8, whatever number of years. Have you noticed that the audience has changed? The desire of the content for the audience has changed? Because, when I started listening to WordPress content, really the only stuff I could find was how tos. It was, here I am, I know stuff about code. I&#8217;m going to tell you about code. Whereas now, if you look around, I feel that you can get news on almost everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you&#8217;ve got news about accessibility. You&#8217;ve got news about governance. You&#8217;ve got news about the plugins. You&#8217;ve got news about the themes, full site editing. The list could go on and on. And it seems almost like we&#8217;ve really properly got a little ecosystem where you don&#8217;t need to code, you could just be a community member talking about the community. So any thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:05] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that. I talk about this topic a lot, I really just put all my cards out on the table and I could be totally wrong and it wouldn&#8217;t, certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the first time. But I think that the audience size, and again, this goes back to your spidey sense from before. I think that the audience size for the type of content that you and I put out is maximum, if you had the whole globe of human beings in front of you, the whole earth is probably about 8,000 people, out of whatever, 8, 9 billion people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s our cap for WordPress news, the inside baseball or how, how the community is put together, the ins and outs of the project, right. I think that the cap is 8,000 people. Now, the cap for how to put together a WooCommerce store, vastly different, right? those are the ones that, I mean, that&#8217;s hundreds of thousands, if not, uh, I don&#8217;t know, millions of people, who would want that kind of content? So I think yes, it has changed. I think the one constant is content that is still developer centric, is still the king of WordPress content, because there&#8217;s just far more WordPress developers who care about how to put sites together, than it is about the business side of WordPress and, maybe the community side, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that it has certainly shifted, although maybe even has gotten even tighter into the development space with the introduction of Gutenberg, full sight editing and just the general changes of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I know that if you told me 10 years ago, could you have made a business out of, whatever I, Matt Report and The WP Minute, I probably would&#8217;ve said no, I&#8217;m just trying to like grow brand awareness, which I was. I think I&#8217;ve successfully turned it, air quote, successfully turned it, into a media business, but it&#8217;s still very, very small. Very appreciative to like the sponsors over the years, and I have done really well compared to the larger podcasting industry, But, the audience I think for the stuff that, at least that I do, not trying to put you in the same bucket as me, is pretty small. It&#8217;s just people going in and out, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Given that we&#8217;ve both hitched our cart to the WordPress space, what are your thoughts about the future? Because I personally feel at least anyway, that the future is quite bright. I&#8217;m fairly optimistic about the progress around full sight editing and the block editor. I can well understand why people have become dissuaded with the desire to use WordPress into the future, I can understand that. But I feel that there&#8217;s light at the end of that tunnel, albeit, I don&#8217;t know how many days, weeks, months, or years it&#8217;s going to be before the train finally emerges out of the tunnel. But for me, it&#8217;s important because I do podcasting. I do content in the WordPress space. I would like to think that WordPress has a bright and glowing future. Maybe you share that optimism or maybe not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:02] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Yeah, I feel like I&#8217;m a realist in the fact that Automattic will take over wordpress.org, and it&#8217;ll just be more of a prominent upsell to either Jetpack or wordpress.com. And there is nothing wrong with that in my eyes, okay. So let&#8217;s just set that aside for a moment. I&#8217;ve recently, so hold that thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve recently been using Ghost, another open source CMS and, I&#8217;m using their paid version because like the folks who would make that decision to not have to maintain WordPress, get a hosting account, do plugins and themes. I said, hey, for this little side, side, side project that I&#8217;m working on, I&#8217;m just going to pay ghosts 30 bucks a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to be carefree like everyone else who picks these no code tools. This is what they&#8217;re all saying. This is why they&#8217;re all moving there. And I&#8217;ll tell you, yes, Ghost is good in the lane that Ghost runs in. But just the other day I was like, ah, I need to add a landing page, or I need to edit the footer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I go to the help docs and it&#8217;s like, install your code editor. Set up a local repo., like run docker containers, and I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t want this. Where&#8217;s my full sight editing? Where&#8217;s my Beaver Builder? Where&#8217;s my Elementor? I just want to edit this one thing. Why can&#8217;t I do it? There is a luxury in WordPress that I think a lot of, a user interface luxury. Uh, a no code luxury. Call it what you want, that when I just want to click something and edit, for all the faults that you hear people complain about speed and performance. Man, put this up against the Ghosts, the Webflows, the Wix&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was looking at card.co, the other, I think it&#8217;s card.co. It&#8217;s like a super simplified like page building, five page portfolio site and I wanted to upload multiple photos. This was for again, the passing of my father-in-law and I wanted to put a little memorial site up, and I had hundreds of photos that I wanted to upload and I had to upload one at a time. And I said, no, I just want you drag a bunch of photos like I do in WordPress into a media gallery and display it. And these other tools just, they just don&#8217;t do it as easy as WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, like you, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m an optimist on using WordPress. It&#8217;s the learning curve and the maintenance. But I think that&#8217;s a world we&#8217;re all slowly moving to where, that will all continue to get simplified by Automattic, by web hosts. Full sight editing. Oh boy. I&#8217;m really struggling with that big time. Gutenberg, yes, there are still some things I really struggle with, but there are some other great tools as alternatives that I use. And that&#8217;s the patchwork that I&#8217;m doing now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> The grass is always greener. There&#8217;s always that, I&#8217;m going to try that other CMS and see how it goes. And I&#8217;ve done the same, I&#8217;ve always ended up back with WordPress. It always seems like a, a comfortable pair of shoes. Terrible analogy, but there you go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:52] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> WordPress, a comfortable pair of shoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:54] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s get into the awkward business of Automattic and your thoughts around that. And you mentioned a moment ago that you thought that wordpress.org was moving inexorably towards being dominated by Automattic. What makes you say that, and does it trouble you? You went to great pains to say that it didn&#8217;t trouble you, but maybe on some level it does?.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:14] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> I think that the biggest factor here is communication, right? It&#8217;s communication from WordPress leadership. It&#8217;s communication from Jetpack and Automattic. These are signs that are quite obvious. So, I forget six months ago or something like that, I interviewed the uh, president or CEO of wordpress.com, talking about their new price points because they had done new price points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the obvious gorilla in the room to me is, what are we doing with WooCommerce? We collectively as Automattic, like, when are you really going to compete with Shopify? And you know, he is, oh, you can compete with Shopify right now. You can just sign up for a WordPress.com. Yeah, but it&#8217;s nothing, it&#8217;s nothing like going to Shopify to start an e-commerce store. Nothing is guiding you as a merchant, as a store seller, as an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these are obvious things that I can see, that everyone can see are the obvious paths to monetization to Automattic. And I think, one, we all step back and say, What would WordPress look like without Automattic? What would that world look like? Who would it be? Would it be Salesforce? Would it be Oracle? Would it be Microsoft? Do you want them in the lead of this software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that the best steward for all of this stuff, .org included, is Automattic. The challenge is, communication, direction. And do we all really get a seat at the table, question mark? And I fight for that seat at the table from my point of view, which is the website builder, the entrepreneur, the user, not a developer, certainly not a developer. But from my perspective, these are the things that I fight for. And I fight for WordPress to be open source because I think it is, in a world where we all go closed source, like I said before, this is things that could impact local economies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a tool that could get somebody who&#8217;s really struggling in life, to get a job in technology because you know how to make a WordPress post. These are the building blocks of the fundamentals of the internet, in my eyes. So, to me it&#8217;s, hey, go Automattic. Tax us, air quotes, tax us. I know this is interesting, me being in New England and you being in England to me, for me to say tax us. But that&#8217;s fine with me. I used to say the same thing when I used to sell themes. Why is this process so difficult? Why don&#8217;t we have the data? Why isn&#8217;t dot org just a marketplace?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am fine getting a 30% tax. If I can sell my goods in a place that&#8217;s trusted, secure, that we&#8217;re true partners with. And it just hasn&#8217;t happened because I feel that all roads lead to, we&#8217;ll monetize WordPress, this is Automattic speaking. We&#8217;ll monetize WordPress through Jetpack, wordpress.org, and then we&#8217;ll eventually upsell, hey, if you don&#8217;t want to host it yourself, come to .com, or Pressable. And I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with that. It&#8217;s just everyone, I think needs to sort of just face the fact and build their business, their plugin business around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I don&#8217;t like is overstepping and, and the hidden paths to upsell without anyone saying anything, ala Jetpack. I still think Jetpack is good for the right user. In fact, I used it on that memorial site because it&#8217;s a fantastic tool for quick and easy. But I think it&#8217;s also going to dominate other SEO plug-ins, other contact form plugins, the blue collar digital workforce that I try to advocate for a lot in the content that I put out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> What do you think about the governance of the project? So at the moment, we have the model, which is often called the benevolent dictator for life, and it kind of trickles down from there. Would you like there to be forays into altering that model? Are you happy with the fact that there is one person governing for life, or would you like to see little bits of that chipped away, chunks of the project, which are governed by the community more?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:00] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> I really appreciate the three conversations that Matt and I have had on my podcast. I think it&#8217;s been three. I don&#8217;t think that there is, when I have a problem with my MacBook, I don&#8217;t call up Tim Cook, and say hey man, come on my podcast, let&#8217;s talk about this Apple ecosystem you&#8217;ve got here, speaking of a 30% tax. It&#8217;s great for us as a community to have a single person that is semi approachable to have conversations with you. To be at WordCamps and have this, literally armed lengths away, to have a conversation with. Having said all of that, yes, I would like change. As I&#8217;ve told Matt, he does an insane amount of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic, wordpress.org, Tumblr, and Automattic is like 25 different products. One of them my favorite, which is Simple Note App, Jetpack, and all the other stuff that he does in life. How can he do it all? And I think that is a real issue. We look at the last couple of weeks ish, he&#8217;s actually talked more openly about where he wants to go with Tumblr than I feel he has with WordPress dot org, and how can you balance that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s a super challenge. I think, he thinks he can do it and he is doing it, but I think there should be some level of change. And Josepha again gracious to have her on the podcast once. How much can she possibly load on her back to do all of the work that she does? So, yes, I mean, I don&#8217;t have the answer for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s easy. I think a lot of people think that it&#8217;s easier said than done. But there should be something, some kind of governance model change, which I know people have pushed for in the past. I just don&#8217;t see how, how Matt can steer so many ships at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:46] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Speaking of steering a lot of ships. You&#8217;ve not only got The WP Minute and various other bits and pieces. You&#8217;ve also got a real interest in how podcasts are made, not just because you&#8217;re making podcasts and you go through that whole editing process and interviewing guests, much like we&#8217;re doing right now. But you&#8217;ve also taken a great interest in the technology behind how podcasts work. Actually just occurs to me, many people might not even know that there is a whole industry behind podcasting, but there is, and Castos is one of them. How long have you been now with Castos and what do you do over there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:19] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Yeah, so two and a half years, something like that. Director of Podcaster success. I try to make podcasters coming in to Castos successful with their podcast, however they might define success, Again, joining Caso because one, I&#8217;m a podcaster, two, they have a fantastic WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a commitment to open source, on the WordPress side, there&#8217;s a commitment to open RSS. These are two worlds that collide greatly with me, and I&#8217;m a huge proponent, of course on open source and open distribution. You know, the perfect example is what&#8217;s the difference? Well, the, difference is a Spotify where you have to have the Spotify app to listen to a particular show, and open RSS means you can subscribe and distribute anywhere that accepts RSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The world of podcasting, it&#8217;s funny, it continues to grow and there continues to be this excitement around it, but it continues to be more in more corporate interest. There is a tiny, tiny, tiny open source team that&#8217;s sort of leading the charge for, I&#8217;ll dumb it down, but RSS standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s called Podcasting 2.0, and you can go to the podcastindex.org, and they run their own index, which is different than Apple, right? So Apple has their index, but you have to, you know, register and do all this stuff with Apple. Podcastindex.org is an open, so think of it as almost like wordpress.org, if you will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;re really leading the charge of enhancing the RSS feed. Doing things, more things in the RSS feed, like micro payment support, transcripts, chapters, live feed item tags, chat, cross platform chat. So they&#8217;re introducing a lot of this data and information that can help podcasters, and their challenges, similar to WordPress. They have to get other podcast hosts and other podcast apps to support these name spaces so that it&#8217;s for the greater good of the whole podcast economy or, or industry, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you know, I&#8217;m a huge proponent of that. Again, to talk about like the approach of Matt, Matt Mullenweg to pull it back. I know, well, Matt&#8217;s from Texas, one of the head guys at Podcast Index is from Texas, Adam Curry, and I sent an email to Matt and Adam and I said, hey, you guys should talk to each other. You both know each other, you&#8217;re both into open source, open distribution. You all should have a conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they, and they had a conversation and that Matt tied together the Pocket Cast team to them, and they had some great conversations. So, yeah, open source, open collaboration, it&#8217;s a great thing and I hope to keep waving that flag for podcasting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s really interesting. I wonder if we are on the cusp of something akin to RSS with things like Mastodon, based upon Activity Hub, which is very like RSS. So essentially it&#8217;s an open platform where you can attach your social media stuff. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve come across this exodus from Twitter over the last couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there seemed to be a lot of people who, over the last few weeks have made up their mind that they would like something a bit more open. They would like to be able to get the content and post the content that they wish without the constraints of being logged in to some proprietary system. And in many of the comments that I&#8217;ve seen in people&#8217;s flight from Twitter, they keep talking about podcasts and how podcasting, 20 years ago, I believe it was Dave Winer who came up with the spec for RSS for podcasts, I could be wrong about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But just how, with the benefit of hindsight, the whole RSS open nature of podcasts, so take Spotify and all those other things out of the equation. The fact that my podcast, your podcast, is available completely for free. You don&#8217;t need any sort of system, particularly, you just need to subscribe to a podcast feed, which is held on the website. Just how breathtakingly clever that was with a bit of hindsight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:03] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Yeah, yeah. Adam Curry as well helped, lead that charge. And he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s sort of leading up the podcast index stuff, and podcasting 2.0 stuff. Yeah, it is great. A lot of the technology is, it&#8217;s very easy to implement, right? It&#8217;s all part of the RSS feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, the challenge is, is sharing that data. So, it&#8217;s a, I don&#8217;t know if platform war is the right phrase for it, but you know, if you have your podcast on Spotify, Spotify can give you more analytics. They can do things in app that are for the better of the, of the listener. But don&#8217;t forget that it will be for the better of Spotify first, because they&#8217;re going to be the ones that run the ads and take a larger chunk of the profits or what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas open RSS, we&#8217;re all fending for ourself, and as the more collaboration and the more people who support the innovations, the better we&#8217;ll all be. But that&#8217;s the challenge. To get everyone on the, on the same page. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s actually no, a lot of similarities to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You mentioned a moment ago that you feel that podcasting is still growing? I, I honestly have no insight into that whatsoever, but it does feel much more of a mainstream thing this year than it was last year and the year before that and so on. Is that in fact the case? Is there still a case to be made, is there data to back up that, yeah, podcasts really are still growing, and if your business or your interest, your hobby is something that you want to plunge into a podcast, it&#8217;s probably worth your time and effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:27] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> You have to kind of look at it, obviously I&#8217;ll call myself an insider to the podcasting space, but there is a lot more money and a lot more interest coming in from what I&#8217;ll call the corporate level. And the corporate level translates into Wondery&#8217;s, Amazon. Amazon owns Wondery, which is probably the premier podcast production company creating fiction, true crime, entertainment podcasts. And that&#8217;s all backed by advertisement. That can be openly distributed, but because Amazon owns it, if you listen to it on Amazon&#8217;s music app, then you get it without the ads. But if you listen to it on Apple Podcasts, you get it with the ads, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s this big interest in advertising, and celebrities and movies and movie industry and all that stuff. Then there&#8217;s the flip side, there&#8217;s you and me. The guys that make probably a few thousand dollars a year, instead of a few million dollars a year, like the big boys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you go to podcastindex.org, I&#8217;m looking at it right now. There&#8217;s 4 million podcasts in the index. I think Apple says around two and a half million. But there is a stat right below that, that within the last three days there&#8217;s been 109,000 updates to podcasts. And in the last 90 days, 483,000 have been updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So of the 4 million, yes, there&#8217;s a bunch that have probably either just ended, you know, it&#8217;s just a series of content that people have done. Pod faded where they have given up. The true earmark to that is 483,000 in the last 90 days. So people get scared of the 4 million mark. Like, oh my God. How is my podcast going to live within 4 million? But when you look at the data of 500,000 active within the last 90 days, you still have a shot, and yes, the answer is it&#8217;s still growing for the hobbyists, like you and I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:14] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s really amazing. I feel so privileged in a way that I made the decision to get into it a little bit early when things were probably less competitive than they are now. That I&#8217;ve just kept banging on with it week week after week. It&#8217;s, yeah, it&#8217;s pretty amazing. Uh, I realize that we&#8217;ve used up a lot more of your time than I should have done, I apologize. So I&#8217;m just going to round off with one very simple question. You&#8217;ve been in the community many, many years. Let&#8217;s imagine five years, 10 years into the future. Do you reckon you&#8217;ll still be</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:40] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, a hundred percent. I&#8217;ll be using WordPress, as far as I can see, again. One, because I love it as a publishing tool. Two because I believe in it as a tool for somebody to learn and educate themselves and, and find a new opportunity, whether that&#8217;s coding, designing or writing. This is a tool that can impact economies. Three, I love, I just love the idea of, of open source on the web and really believe in that wholeheartedly. So yeah, I see myself sticking around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Matt Medeiros, thank you for joining us on the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:12] <strong>Matt Medeiros:</strong> Thanks, Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://craftedbymatt.com/about-matt/\">Matt Medeiros</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt is the driving force behind many WordPress initiatives. That could be the creation of plugins, WordPress news media, as well as podcasts about all manner of WordPress specific subjects. He likes to juggle multiple projects at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently he’s the Director of Podcaster Success at <a href=\"https://castos.com/\">Castos</a>, which is a podcast hosting company with a WordPress plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s on the podcast today to give his take on the past, present and future of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many millions of people like to work with the WordPress software. They create websites, plugins and themes which extend what the CMS can do. Others, such as Matt, like to ponder the broader purpose and direction of the software and the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mattreport.com/\">The Matt Report</a> and <a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/\">The WP Minute</a> have enabled us to hear about what the community is doing, what it wants and where its points of friction are. He’s talked to hundreds of people about what WordPress was, is, and might be, and so is in a unique position to pontificate about what WordPress, beyond the software, is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start with Matt’s backstory. How he found WordPress and why he started to use it. We talk about how he’s dipped in and out of the community over the years; more excited at times, less so at others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation moves on to some of the trends that Matt has noticed. He identifies how the software and the wider community have altered over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about how The WP Minute got started and how he’s building up a community of like-minded people to consume as well as to create the content that they’re putting out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end, we get into the governance of WordPress and the future of the project more generally. There are certainly things that Matt likes, but there are some wrinkles which get aired as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We finish up talking about podcasts and Matt’s work with Castos and how they are trying to make it easier to get your voice out there, especially with their WordPress integration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a lovely chat with a thoughtful and far sighted member of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mattreport.com/\">Matt Report</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/\">The WP Minute</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://castos.com/\">Castos</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Nov 2022 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 14.6 Adds List View for Editing Navigation Block, Introduces New Automatic Color Palette Generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=139909\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-14-6-adds-list-view-for-editing-navigation-block-introduces-new-automatic-color-palette-generator\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4827:\"<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/11/23/whats-new-in-gutenberg-14-6-23-november/\">Gutenberg 14.6</a> was released last week with a long list of small but impactful refinements to core blocks and the full-site editing experience. One of the most practical enhancements included in this update is the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45546\">new list view for editing the Navigation block</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg contributor Fabian Kägy published a quick video that helps to visualize the changes: </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The list view makes it easy for users to reorder navigation items using a drag-and-drop UI. The Navigation block in the content area instantly previews items that are moved in the block inspector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of a larger effort to make it easier to edit Navigation Links off the canvas, this release also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45751\">adds a new URL field to the Navigation Link inspector</a> controls. Now user can edit the URL from the inspector controls as well as from the main link control.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: PR <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45751\">45751</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 14.6 also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/43496\">adds a variation picker to the Group block placeholder</a>. When users insert a new Group block, it will now allow them to select from among different variations to set the layout for the block. This makes it significantly easier for users to get started when using a Group block, instead of having to fiddle around to manually assign the desired layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most creative features introduced in this release is the new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40988\">“Randomize colors” feature</a> that will automatically generate color palettes on the fly. It utilizes hue rotations based on the <a href=\"https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~dag/CUBEHELIX/\">Cubehelix color scheme</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Hue rotation consists in rotating the hue wheel — such as the one you<br />might see in a color picker — by a determined amount of degrees, each turn<br />generating a new color,&#8221; Gutenberg contributor Vicente Canales said in the PR for the feature. He also noted that this new feature surfaces &#8220;the need for themes to explicitly support style randomization, as well as the need to incorporate a way to define a color&#8217;s role within a palette as a way of avoiding getting, for example, palettes where background and foreground don&#8217;t contrast, rendering text illegible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>While randomizing color palettes is a fun feature for users, some theme and plugin developers do not see the need for it to land in core Gutenberg and eventually WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s fun, but from a theme designer&#8217;s perspective I don&#8217;t see an urgent use since the theme designer can provide numerous style variations,&#8221; block and theme developer Ellen Bauer <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/40988#issuecomment-1316048575\">commented</a> on the PR. &#8220;For the user this provides the same kind of &#8216;fun feel&#8217;, but theme designers would provide an experience that actually works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is so much potential in styles, but not much is published yet. So as a theme builder I feel style export/imports, the option to separate font styles from color styles are much more basic features I would love to have first.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newsletter Glue co-founder Lesley Sim agreed that it&#8217;s a fun idea but that anyone using a theme will probably rely on the theme&#8217;s style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And that will probably feel like a randomizer to them already,&#8221; Sim said. &#8220;At least, that&#8217;s how I personally view style variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d much rather focus on basic features first too, rather than fun ones. Let plugin and theme developers build the fun.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable features in Gutenberg 14.6 include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Block Toolbar is now hidden when Spacing Visualizer is displayed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New keyboard shortcut for transforming Paragraph block into Heading block</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Focal Point handle updated to be more representative of the broader selection area</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New “Minimum Height” dimension control is now available for the Group and Post Content block</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This update&#8217;s performance benchmarks for the site editor and post editor are significantly improved for three out of four metrics over the last release.

The overly was powered by <a href=\"https://www.equalweb.com/html5/?_id=8591&did=1116&_gid=202027&trace=equalweb_menu_en_\">EqualWeb</a>, a product which claims to provide automated compliance with accessibility standards but doesn&#8217;t address inaccessibility at the root of the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Community Team leaders requested a meeting with the company and were able to persuade them to take the overlay down and focus on direct improvements to the Meetup.com platform. WordPress community organizer Angela Jin reported that their director of engineering and other team members were &#8220;very receptive to our feedback.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;EqualWeb’s widget does scan for accessibility issues, and the original plan was for EqualWeb’s team (real people!) to provide progressive fixes to the overlay,&#8221; Jin said. &#8220;Meetup’s hope was to provide, over time, a fully accessible overlay.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the meeting, WordPress&#8217; Community Team representatives contended that overlays create a poor user experience for people who use assistive technology while also ignoring key WCAG issues. This is why there are growing legal and privacy concerns associated with the overlays, which do not deliver on the promise of providing equal and open access to platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After reporting on the issue earlier this month, one reader asked if the overlays  actually work to address the issues and, if so, what is motivating the complaint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;They don’t work,&#8221; WordPress accessibility contributor Joe Dolson said. &#8220;To the degree that they do work, they mostly offer functionality that is already duplicated by the user’s own technology.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dolson examined Meetup.com&#8217;s overlay and highlighted a few of its major shortcomings:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This particular overlay also commits the cardinal sin of labeling tools by disability, rather than according to what they do. For example, if you turn on the “Visually Impaired” mode, that’s actually a high contrast mode; which is only relevant if your visual impairment benefits from high contrast. This kind of presumptive labeling is ineffective at best (because it makes it difficult to find what tool might actually help you, should you need it), and offensive at worst.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the reality is that overlay tools are a misdirection of resources: if a user needs high contrast, large fonts, or other tools, they need those on <em>all</em> websites, and they need a solution that’s their tool, in their control, with their settings – and the majority of users already have that in their assistive technology.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of revising its accessibility roadmap, Meetup.com is requesting feedback from WordPress community members with experience using its platforms across devices with accessibility features enabled. Those who have 50 minutes in the coming weeks can request to speak with Meetup representatives regarding which features should be prioritized. People can also leave feedback in the comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meetup.com&#8217;s decision to remove the overlay was well-received by accessibility advocates who hope to see more changes to the platform&#8217;s source code based on community feedback in the next few weeks. Beyond these changes, some community members are also recommending Meetup.com add people with disabilities to their team to get more first-hand information without having to publicly walk back an implementation like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Although I applaud Meetup for removing the Overlay, they are going at this backwards,&#8221; WordPress user @bryan202 said in the comments. &#8220;They should have an independent company who employs persons with disabilities to audit their platform and inform them of the issues. If Meetup wants feedback on the specific issues this choice of overlay caused, then they should be willing to pay for that market feedback. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As a disabled person we are constantly called upon to give feedback for free. We deserve to be respected for our time, efforts and feedback. Meetup needs to expand their technical team to include persons with disabilities so they have an inside look since their current team is missing this essential component.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Nov 2022 03:18:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 44: Minors, Majors, and Why We Have So Many Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=13996\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/episode-44-minors-majors-and-why-we-have-so-many-releases/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8340:\"<p>In the forty-fourth episode of the WordPress Briefing, our host Josepha Haden Chomphosy highlights the role of major and minor releases in the WordPress open source project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:27]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top of November, a new major release for WordPress shipped. That was WordPress 6.1. I know I talked about it basically nonstop. Then two weeks later, there was a new minor release for WordPress. It was WordPress 6.1.1, which I did not talk about at all. Way back in episode four of this podcast, I dug into the overall release cycle and what someone could expect from a high-level logistics aspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today we&#8217;re gonna take a quick look at minor releases in particular. Just as a general heads up, I always want to lean into sports metaphors when I&#8217;m talking about releases, and I think it&#8217;s because of the words major and minor. And so, I&#8217;ve done my level best to not include that in any of my explanations today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do have one, I do have one that&#8217;s a sports thing. So just if you don&#8217;t like sports, know that it&#8217;s just one little bit and we&#8217;ll try to be carefully quick around it together. All right, so minor releases. You may have noticed that I don&#8217;t mention minor releases nearly as often as I mention major releases. And yet, most of the time, when we have a major release of WordPress, there&#8217;s a minor release that gets started almost immediately after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first major versus minor. Major releases in WordPress happen roughly three times a year, give or take a release. Inside a major release, you will find that we include features, so– brand new abilities, enhancements, which you can generally call improvements to existing abilities, and also any bug fix that we can find, big or small, we&#8217;ll take &#8217;em all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So minor releases in WordPress happen about four or five times a year on average. Minor releases include patches for issues introduced in the major release and any bug fix that doesn&#8217;t add or change functionality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re with me so far, you probably have noted that there&#8217;s basically always at least one minor release per major release. And you might have also noted that I said minors include patches for issues we introduced in a major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if I were hearing this with fresh ears, the first thing I would wonder is, okay, so if you start working on the minor right after you release the major to deal with issues you know you introduced in the major– why just not ship the major while there are bugs in it? Great question. I&#8217;m glad you asked. So there are a few things worth knowing here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there is this concept of “ship and iterate,” which is present in both agile and open source. The idea is that we ship software as soon as we have confidence that what is in the release is non-breaking and represents our best guests at a better experience for our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that is out there, we use feedback on the initial release to quickly iterate and ship another release. That way, we don&#8217;t hold back any good features. And since we already planned the immediate minor, any major issues that show up can be fixed in as little as two weeks. Secondly, there is the concept that with many eyes, all bugs are shallow, which is primarily present in open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea here is that with enough people looking at a problem, that problem doesn&#8217;t stand a chance. So when a release is shipped in a workable state but with interactions that could use some refinement, the fastest way to find those refinements is to take it to the community of WordPress users and developers and invite them to co-create this CMS with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which touches on my final thought. The concept of the user as co-creator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we think about the development and evolution of our software as a team effort, then we can think of the people who use our software as what&#8217;s called the “Twelfth Man” That&#8217;s in quotes, and I will, I&#8217;ll leave a link to that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In sports, this refers to the fans. And if you&#8217;ve ever been to a live sporting event or played in any, you will know that the cheering and jeering from fans turns into this distinct motivating entity all its own. As a whole team or individual member, you know what you have to do. You know what you need to do in a game, but there&#8217;s something about that chaotic, loud roar of feedback that just brings life to what you&#8217;re doing, and that&#8217;s how I see our community of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at the end of the day, the answer to the question of ‘why so many releases’ and the follow-up question of ‘why tolerate stable imperfection’ is largely the same. To get features into the hands of our users quickly so that we can always be breathing life into this CMS we care so much about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that answers your questions about our release cadence, and if you didn&#8217;t come into this podcast having any questions about release cadences at all, I hope this new information brings a little extra light to the complexity of working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big thing number one is that the State of the Word has been announced and is scheduled for December 15th. It&#8217;s a little earlier in the day than in past iterations, so I hope we get a new crew of listeners tuning in at the same time. I&#8217;ll leave a link to that in the show notes, or you can pop over to wordpress.org/news to see the announcement for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big thing number two is that team rep nominations are open on most teams right now. So if organization and people wrangling are high on your list of ways you can give back to WordPress, head on over to the team you contribute to and see how you raise your hand for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then big thing number three is that big-picture goals, hopes, and timelines are being gathered, and I will ship those shortly after the start of the new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will give us all an idea of where we want to focus our attention to ensure that WordPress continues to grow toward the future. You can keep an eye out for that on make.wordpress.org/project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 28 Nov 2022 12:00:00

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about the new Developer Blog Public Beta, Gutenberg 14.5, 14.6 and what&#8217;s in the work on for the Block Editor. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. And I&#8217;m thrilled that my friend, Ryan Welcher, core contributor, livestream on Twitch and developer advocate joined me today. Again, yeah, you&#8217;ve been on the show before. Good afternoon, Ryan. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I&#8217;m good, Birgit. Thanks for having me again. I&#8217;m always excited to hang out with you and talk Gutenberg release notes and all this stuff. Yeah. I&#8217;m excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We do to have you here. So yesterday, you had your weekly Twitch stream again. And you had a break of three weeks and you came back and so what was it about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Well, for the past two weeks&#8230; well, the first week back I spent trying to relearn how to use computers and the internet because it was three weeks off. I didn&#8217;t have a clue what I was doing. So the last couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve been focusing on Query Loop Block variations. So this week or yesterday, I actually started building a plugin that introduced controls to the Query Loop Block to be able to do more complicated and more advanced queries. And so I&#8217;ll probably be doing that for the next couple of streams and then hopefully releasing that into the wild for developers or anyone to use really. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haac</em>k: Oh, that&#8217;s cool. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. You can check me out at RyanWelchercodes is my handle on Twitch. Every Thursday at 10:30 Eastern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And if you missed any of Ryan&#8217;s Twitch streams, they go silent on Twitch. But Ryan always makes the additional effort to put them up on your YouTube channel. That&#8217;s the same username, youtube.com/ryanwelchercodes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> That&#8217;s right, yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I always have to follow up because it&#8217;s really great stuff that you put out there and I learn so much about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Oh, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Not only how to do it well, but also to how to get to doing it well and see what you&#8217;re struggle with. And I&#8217;m really good-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah. 80% of my stream is me spelling things horribly and typoing like crazy and then not knowing why something&#8217;s broken. So, yeah, I have some viewers that are regulars that help me out all the time. Shout out to Kevin, he knows who he is. Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. And we have a good show for you dear listeners today. And for the American listeners, it&#8217;s all happy Thanksgiving. And also I hope you have a great time on Black Friday and then serve on Monday. So I will be, over the weekend, at a cricket game tournament in Sarasota. And so we are doing this recording today and then I&#8217;m off to my weekend.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have a couple announcements that came in from project and one of we are all involved, you and I. That&#8217;s the WordPress Developer Blog is in public beta. And so it came out of discussion or year-long complaints or many years is that staying on top of the new features that are coming to WordPress. Open source is really one of the main barriers for developers to get started on the Block Editor, the site editor and doing stuff with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Core Block where most of the information is released has a very heavy emphasis for meeting nodes of the various core teams. And also it only highlights the new features that came with a major release. But for the Gutenberg plugin or what&#8217;s in the works on the PHP site, there is not a central place. It&#8217;s difficult for developers who are not contributors to get anything out of those make blogs as a relevant information. So the content will or focuses on the updates for developers, extenders who create plugins and themes and those who work with WordPress at an agency or as freelancers. And you were one of them working at an agency, also a free freelancer. So I really appreciate your continuing input on what is needed for agencies on the new features and how does it work there also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s really good that we have now a place where that information can be shared. And it&#8217;s in beta, so there are not a whole lot of posts there, but that&#8217;s definitely going to change next year. We have three posts there. One is Ryan&#8217;s post on how to extend the WordPress wire slot fill system. What is that about, Ryan?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: So a slot fill system is an extension paradigm that was introduced with the Block Editor with WordPress 5.0. And it&#8217;s a way of extending UIs, let&#8217;s put it that way. So you can inject your own elements into certain areas inside of the Block Editor and inside the site editor now. And, yeah, the article there is sort of preliminary. Sort of deep but not too deep. Deep enough to get started. And it&#8217;s based on a couple of talks that I&#8217;ve given in the past. So if you&#8217;re looking to extend the UI for the site editor or for the Block Editor, I&#8217;d go and take a look at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, yeah, it&#8217;s kind of code heavy, but it&#8217;s one of the reasons why the Developer Blog, I think, is going to be so important because normally I would write this on my own personal blog. And now we have a central place where we can share this information, it&#8217;s sort of official, and people know where to go and they don&#8217;t have to know who I am or what my web address is or any of that stuff to be able to get the information that I&#8217;m trying to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s a very good point. Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot of information out there that&#8217;s decentralized and bringing them all in or bring the writers in. Daisy Olsen has a post and she demystifies the home and post templates for the WordPress theme development. It&#8217;s not necessarily focused on block themes, that&#8217;s pretty much&#8230; it shows you for classic themes as well as for block themes. And then Justin Tadlock has a post where he helps theme developers think about block theme development from a pattern first mindset to avoid redundancy in code and also to have some simplicity more in the theme development. And I think that all three of them are really excellent hosts there. So I&#8217;m so excited about this and I know a lot of people are to kind of see what comes out of that. Yeah, so check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a page there that gives you a little bit more history about that and also a page that says how you can contribute if you want to be a writer or if you want to be a reviewer or you want to just kind of add your ideas to it, go there. And it&#8217;s mainly managed through GitHub so you get even an additional kind of insight in how GitHub works, even if you&#8217;re not so code centric and had always shied away. But believe me, it&#8217;s always a good place to be as a WordPress contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I just want to kind of reiterate what you&#8217;re saying about how anyone can write for the Developer Blog. It&#8217;s not gated in the sense of&#8230; there is a process and ideas and content may not be accepted, but that&#8217;s based on topic, not based on who&#8217;s contributing it. So I think it&#8217;s really important to understand that it&#8217;s not just for certain folks and it&#8217;s not just for contributors or whoever, it&#8217;s for whoever really wants to. And as long as you sort of adhere to the process, there&#8217;s no reason why I could say anybody wouldn&#8217;t be able to add content to the Developer Blog. It&#8217;s truly open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And can also be reused because it&#8217;s going to be in public domain. So that&#8217;s the GPL part of it. Yeah. Another announcement came down the pipe, which is that core committer and Peter Wilson, and he&#8217;s also member of the security team, announced that WordPress will drop support for WordPress 3.7 and 4.0 on December 1st. And you might ask, &#8220;What? They&#8217;re still supporting that? I thought it was only the last two WordPress versions.&#8221; That is true. Officially, WordPress only supports the last two major versions, but the security team had always also applied security updates to previous versions from 3.7 to 6.03. They all got the same security updates. And that is to end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 4.0, they get one more update that will announce that there won&#8217;t be any future updates in the WP admin. So if you have these old versions in the stable of your clients, make sure that you upgrade to the later versions. I looked at the WordPress stats for that. So there is a stat online that gives you how many people are on which version on WordPress. And all four versions come together at 0.5% of WordPress installations. So, yeah, it&#8217;s a good decision. They wanted to do it last year but somehow it didn&#8217;t make it. Now it&#8217;s this year. So I just wanted to let everybody know the 3.7 to 4.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: It just amazes me that WordPress versions that far back still work. People are still able to run it and I just think that&#8217;s fantastic. You should update. If you&#8217;re running 3.7, you should update. There&#8217;s a lot of functionality that you&#8217;re missing out on, but it&#8217;s amazing that it still works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> I wanted to look up when 3.7 was actually released and I think it was 2010 or something like that, but I can verify that. Maybe not. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> March 14th, 2017? That makes sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, yeah. Could be. Could be. Yeah. Yeah. We are only at 3.0 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Sorry, I was looking at the wrong place. October 24th, 2013, version 3.7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Was named for Count Basie. Interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: 2013. So that is a nine year old version, and nothing on your computer should be nine years old. And not on the survey either or be just accessible by the public on the internet. Yeah, for sure. Update.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ll come to sections what&#8217;s released? And since the last show on October 30th recorded, we had two WordPress releases. One was a major release 6.1 and we talked about it. Yay. We talked about it quite a few times here and I definitely will share again the field guide link in the show notes. And then there was another release on November 15th for the 6.1.1. And it&#8217;s about roughly 50 bug fixes that didn&#8217;t make it in at 6.1 or came out after 6.1 was released. So that was a major effort from the release team 14 days after a major release to come up with a point release to get all the bug fixes in the hands of the WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s also a release from WooCommerce Blocks 9.0. Just for those who don&#8217;t know, WooCommerce Blocks is the bleeding edge plugin from WooCommerce similar to the Gutenberg plugin relates to the WordPress software. So using it, you can test all the future features coming to WooCommerce and help improve them before they&#8217;re actually released in WooCommerce. And the 9.0 the release came out this week. Actually today, and it&#8217;s November 25th, 2022. So they updated the options to customize products with an attribute template from the site editor, which sounds really cool. And then they improved the performance of product blocks by removing some fragments that were in there. And then they also cleared out some validation errors that were visible. A nice quality of life enhancement is that the placeholder for blocks who has placeholders&#8230; so the cover block, the image block, the gallery block, they all have placeholders that they take on the main store color coming from the theme JSON file. That&#8217;s kind of really nice. It&#8217;s, of course, an experimentation, but that is certainly something that any theme developer might want to look at how they implement that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah, that&#8217;s really neat. I&#8217;d love to take a look and see. I&#8217;ve always been intrigued because I do a lot of block development, especially on my streams, and I&#8217;m always intrigued by how much can I interface? If I had a block that just didn&#8217;t matter where it was installed, if it could take on certain aspects of theme.JSON, I think that would be super neat. I mean I think some of that stuff just trickles down by default, but I&#8217;d be interested to take a deeper look at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. In Gutenberg, there was also a feature where you can access the theme JSON through some hooks and filters in 6.1, but I&#8217;m not sure how robust that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: You can filter it as and add new things to it, but I&#8217;d be interested to see how it works. And I just haven&#8217;t put in the research so I don&#8217;t know. But I mean I&#8217;d be interested to see if there&#8217;s a data store on the JavaScript side where we could retrieve that stuff because you can get Block Editor information. I just have to do the research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That will be for the, what did you say? The next couple of Twitch streams are still Query Block and then the third one from now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s a great idea integrating&#8230; thinking about JSON into your blocks, using values from there to do things in a block, that&#8217;d be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think that makes whatever block in you have kind of very versatile and kind of migrates from theme to theme. But I also think that you probably need some standards as the naming convention on how you kind of primary, secondary, tertiary kind of colors. So I think as long as we don&#8217;t have them, it can be hit and miss. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. I mean as soon as it&#8217;s up to somebody naming something, that&#8217;s like what? The second hardest thing to do in computer and software development is naming things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What&#8217;s the hardest thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Recursion I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I can&#8217;t remember who said that. Somebody smarter than me anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And, yeah, Gutenberg 4.5 was released on November 9th and we have a few enhancements there. It was not a very heavy release because everybody still came off of the November 1st 6.1 release and I&#8217;m still moving some stuff around.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There were some enhancement for Create Block for instance and I&#8217;m sure&#8230; you were, I think, involved in that to update to use the APIs. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yep. So the Create Block package is near and dear to my heart. And this one actually allowed us to create&#8230; so backing up, when you use the Create Block package, you can also create external templates. And so those templates will define how your plugin is structured and how your block is structured. And part of that templating system, there&#8217;s a series of default values that you can pass. And so what this commit did was it allowed you to use the Render property because in 6.1, the block API introduced Render as a block.JSON property where you can pass the path to a file and that file will be used for dynamic blocks. It&#8217;s a PHP file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so what that did, that allows you to do away with having to call Render call back and defining a function when you&#8217;re registering a block. So it&#8217;s made block registration a lot easier, but we needed to update the Create Block package to be able to work with that system. As a template author, you can define what the name of that file is, where it lives and all those sort of things. So that&#8217;s what that did. That&#8217;s a long way of explaining it. Just caught one thing up to the other thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it was cool. That&#8217;s cool. Thank you so much. And we all need kind of a little bit more explanation about these things that are just one headline from&#8230; that&#8217;s what we are doing here at the podcast. So in the Style Engine, that&#8217;s kind of the engine that&#8217;s behind&#8230; that&#8217;s the black box behind the theme JSON file that kind of tries to manage all the user inputs, the block JSON attributes, the styles from the theme and the default style from the Block Editor. And nowadays, support the dimensions minimum height property. So you could have, for all kind of blocks, but it&#8217;s now available. And that&#8217;s really cool because then you can say, &#8220;Okay, my Core Block or my cover block has a certain minimum height to fill up and can also inherit that to the other blocks that are there.&#8221; Yeah. So it&#8217;s all cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And then the comment template, post comment count, post comment form and post common links, they all got now also spacing support. So for your site editor and template. So you can actually&#8230; then here you can remove the spacer block and control it all with the blocks there. For another social icon, they got a new attribute and that&#8217;s the rel attribute, R-E-L, which is needed for something that&#8217;s happened on the rest outside of the WordPress universe, which is that Twitter had some implosion things coming on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, some stuff happened over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Some stuff happened there. I don&#8217;t want to really belabor that, but if you want to&#8230; so the social link block now has a Mastodon block variation, but the Mastodon variation also lets you verify your website with your Mastodon account. So you can say or can prove, &#8220;Okay, I am the person who belongs to this website.&#8221; And it then gives you a check mark in the Mastodon profile. And George Hotelling, he&#8217;s a WordPress co con&#8230; what is it? A core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> That&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And he wrote a short tutorial on how to do this and verify your WordPress site with Mastodon. So if you have the need or wish or just want to check it out on Mastodon as a replacement for Twitter, a lot of people have registered Mastodon accounts since Elon Musk took over Twitter. And I think they are now on 2 million within a week, new accounts. So there&#8217;s definitely a wave there. And you can&#8217;t leave Twitter until you tell your followers where you will be. So it&#8217;s definitely a good way to at least get a Mastodon account and get it verified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I have to get a Mastodon account. Do you have one, Birgit? Do you have a Mastodon account?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I have two, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: You have two? Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I have one on-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I&#8217;m always playing catch up with you. You&#8217;re so bleeding edge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Totally, totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: These new technology, not only do you have an account, you have two accounts and you&#8217;re the lead community contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, I looked at the Mastodon account and then my browser kind of said, &#8220;Oh, you have an account? Here&#8217;s your password.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Oh?&#8221; And then I looked at it-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: You&#8217;re an early adopter. Well before the Twitter nonsense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I looked at it and it was from 2017 and had not a single post and three followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So I pinned on my new account on my profile. So if you want to follow me or you have left Twitter and you want to kind of look at it and you want to connect with me again, do that. I also pinned my Tumblr account, which I set up in 2008 I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. I actually have a Tumblr account that I think I set up back when I was doing Flash development. That&#8217;s how long ago it was. So I need to get that updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So now we got that out of the way. The second account that I have was the Gutenberg Times of course. Yeah. It&#8217;s a separate account. So if you don&#8217;t want the other things that I post on Twitter or on Mastodon, yeah. And WordPress only then the Gutenberg Times account on TWiT Social actually. TWiT is a long time podcast and live show technology podcast by Leo Laporte. And I have been following this week in Google Show, that&#8217;s the since, I don&#8217;t know, 10 years ago. And they have a Mastodon instance on their server. I like the name of it. It&#8217;s not Twitter but it&#8217;s TWiT. It&#8217;s not social. So I like that. And they also have an instance that is a little bit more moderated so it&#8217;s not anybody could come because they want to kind of keep the community tech oriented. So I think that&#8217;s a good place to be. But you can follow from any other Mastodon instance on the Gutenberg Times Stream there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What else is in there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I think we were on post editor. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I highlighted that, a little piece there, is just to reiterate that there is a distraction free mode in Gutenberg plugin now that kind of hides all the interface items when you write or at all. So the toolbar on top, the side settings, but also the block toolbar that comes up or any other things that sometimes spring up and distract you from &#8216;what does it now&#8217; want kind of thing. And now also the notices are now improved that come up on the edit post screen. For instance, the saving part and the transform part when you transform things and all that. That&#8217;s nicely improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, it looks really nice on the screenshot that they have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> The next one there is…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: So moving the document information into the outline deal, which is interesting to me. So if you want to know the word count and all that, you normally go up into the&#8230; there&#8217;s one of the buttons, I can&#8217;t remember what it was, what it looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. It&#8217;s a little I or the info one. But now it&#8217;s been moved down to the bottom of the list view, which I don&#8217;t necessarily hate. This is the first I&#8217;ve seen this one, but I wonder is that an option or is that only in specific instances or is it always going to be there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s always right now. I think the last word hasn&#8217;t been spoken yet about that. It definitely needs some additional accessibility review and improvements and it also is missing some information. So I think the time to read comes up if your post is longer than a minute, then you get the time to read. And the number of blocks is, I think, mission. But you also get the outline as well. And that&#8217;s a little bit of a duplication between&#8230; so the outline is just the headers that are in your document and in the list view, you also see all the blocks that are in there. So it&#8217;s kind of a reduced&#8230; I like that the information is now just in one panel and it declutters the top toolbar because I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re going to get additional information there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Almost guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I know that some plugins you signed as well. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah. I would love to see this leverage the preferences. The preferences so a user can decide where they want that because that could be something that you&#8230; I can see use cases on both sides of it. I don&#8217;t care about it, I&#8217;m in distraction-free mode whatever. Or I just wanted to be able to be nice and quick because I have a word count that I&#8217;m trying to hit or something. So I can see that. I can see people loving this and handling this as with always the case with anytime we change anything. But I think it&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I definitely wanted to mention it here because I heard from quite a few people that thought, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s missing now, what did I do?&#8221; Kind of thing. It&#8217;s actually hidden and there is no notification that, &#8220;Look here if you&#8217;re looking for that&#8221; kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, they used to do that a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: And they haven&#8217;t done yet for this one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> They used to have those little blue arrows. Do you remember that pre-Gutenberg days when something would move and all of a sudden there&#8217;d be a little blue arrow that says, &#8220;Hey, this thing&#8217;s over here now&#8221;? Yeah, it&#8217;d be cool if they did that again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Do they have that feature or kind of the API for that in Gutenberg? I think that will be a good API to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: They have the modal that pops up the first time that you go into the Block Editor. That might be something to leverage when there&#8217;s an update that gets triggered again with like, &#8220;Hey, do you want to see what&#8217;s new?&#8221; And then everyone will hate it and turn it off. But it might be an interesting thing to leverage to kind of save people from trying to figure out where the heck something went or them feeling like they broke something and&#8230; anyways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, I totally agree. I totally agree. There are quite a few apps that do this quite well that they have a little notification bell somewhere and they just change the color of it and you know there&#8217;s something new. So when you have time to browse that, yeah, you&#8217;re going to go there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. Especially something where you&#8217;re using-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Does Twitch have that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, it does. And a lot of desktop apps will do that and stuff like that. So I think it&#8217;s a nice consideration for a user to be able to say, &#8220;Oh, hey. Something&#8217;s changed and you can opt into it.&#8221; So maybe just having it popped up is not the best way to doing it, but having some notification that shows up that says there&#8217;s been some changes to the UI, would you like to see what they are? I think that&#8217;d be kind of neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And with all those changes coming…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: So you talk to your people about that and I&#8217;ll talk to my people about that. We&#8217;ll see what happens. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Anyhow, what&#8217;s the next thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: What&#8217;s the next thing? Yeah, I&#8217;m kind of browsing past the bug fixes and I saw a headline that&#8217;s called Meta Boxes. And I was looking at that and the PR is that perform has Meta Boxes check on every safe which I really appreciate now because there have been very much quite some instances where I changed something in a Meta Box but I didn&#8217;t hit save. And then I went out there and that thing was also not updated, although all the Block Editor edits were updated. So it now does that in every auto save as well so you&#8217;re not losing any data from your Meta Boxes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Now when you say Meta Boxes, are you saying&#8230; the first thing that comes to mind is register Meta Box in the original way that you&#8217;d do that. Is that what you&#8217;re talking about or just-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So the Meta Boxes on the bottom of a screen in the Block Editor like Yoast has them and newsletter…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Stuff like that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And those boxes were not always saved unless you physically saved it. So the auto save would not catch up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Oh, that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s so nice because that is horribly annoying when you&#8217;ve been messing around with stuff and then you navigate away, that doesn&#8217;t trigger the &#8216;are you sure&#8217;? And then you&#8217;ve lost your work. That&#8217;s nice. That&#8217;s really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Especially when you&#8217;re so accustomed to the every 15 seconds auto save kicks in and you don&#8217;t have to worry about it. All of a sudden you have to worry again. Yeah, it&#8217;s a little bit counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we come to the documentation section and there was one thing, that was the Storyboard intro. And the Storybook, not Storyboard, Storybook. Storybook is a tool that allows you to see each WordPress component from the Block Editor in isolation. And you see what values are in there, what action you can have there and you can kind of make some changes and then see how that happens. And this Storybook site didn&#8217;t have an intro page. You landed there and it says hello world. And so a few of us got together and updated it so you can learn more about it and also how to…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Take the credit, Birgit. This was all you. You did this and some people helped. So props to you. It&#8217;s quite literally the definition of devral is making this easier to understand. I remember when I started first playing around with this Storybook instance, specifically I was like, &#8220;Why is it just say hello world?&#8221; And then it would fall off my radar. Yeah. So thank you. From the community, officially thanking you for doing this and making it better. So that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I actually used this tool today. It&#8217;s so helpful not only for reference guides, but, for example, WordPress icons. Way down the bottom of that list on the left hand side, you can see all of the available icons. And so I was working on that plugin today and I used it and it&#8217;s a handy dandy little tool to show you what&#8217;s available and you can see it in real time and see the different states of things. It&#8217;s very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. No, I think it improves development. Not only improves it but also speeds it up because you can go there and say, &#8220;So what is that component?&#8221; You can grab the example code and put it in your component and see how the first version looks. And so it&#8217;s really good. We&#8217;ll share the tool in the show notes of course so you can check it out yourself and see if you want to use it for your development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the other documentation issue that I wanted to highlight was that the curating the editor experience is a page in the Block Editor handbook. And that was updated with the content lock ability or the content only lock ability. So it&#8217;s a WordPress 6.1 new feature and I also link to the developer notes in the show notes. But it practically lets you lock down a pattern for instance. Just that the user only can change the content of the headline, but not the headline itself, the content of the paragraph or just upload a new image. But a block pattern itself stays as it is. So I think that is pretty far reaching because a lot of people build custom blocks because they wanted to lock down content and not have people or users kind of change things. And there is actually no need for that if you now with the content only blocks or patterns because now you just use a normal Core Blocks, a collection of Core Blocks and lock down the changing and only open up the content for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah, I think it&#8217;s super powerful. I know coming from the agency world, that was one thing that being able to stop people from creating every iteration of button color on the planet because you have to design for that and you have to count for that and stuff. So being able to just manage the content of something and leave everything else alone, I think, is going to help a lot of people. And this, sorry, explains it a little bit better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And, again, it speeds up building websites considerably if you don&#8217;t have to have a developer create your custom block to have that feature there. So really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So that was the Gutenberg 14.5. And without any further ado, we go to Gutenberg 14.6 that came out this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 14.6</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh we didn&#8217;t say 14.9, the release lead was Nick Diego and he also posted the release document. Gutenberg 14.6, Fabian Kagey, was the release lead and that was came out two days ago on Wednesday. And so, yeah, there are quite a few enhancements. Again, it&#8217;s a much richer plugin release than 14.5 was. And we have a few things that we wanted to point out. The first one is in the block library. So the navigation block is in major revamp just because you need more space to manage your menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in 14.6, you now find that the navigation block has an added list view in the side bar and you can have more space to actually create your menu, select the menus, add a new link to a menu instead of doing it all in the small little space that you had next to the insert on the navigation block. So that&#8217;s definitely something to check out. And then also the navigation link. It now has a URL feed to the inspector control. So the inspector controls itself, you get a URL, you get names and all that additional features for your links and that is definitely useful. What else is in there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Make author block, select or display all users instead of just 10. I just looked at that. It&#8217;s not all users, it&#8217;s a hundred users. If you have more than 100 users on your site, you&#8217;re kind of a special use case anyways I would imagine. So that should encompass the majority of users, but that&#8217;s pretty nice. Yeah. I&#8217;m not sure the column address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the columns block now has a transform that kind of unwraps the content. Meaning if you get it out of the columns into a normal&#8230; so if you have a head and image in a paragraph in a column and you look at unwrap the content, it comes out of the column and-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Oh, that&#8217;s super handy. That&#8217;s super handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. I can&#8217;t figure out where I put this, but now I can kind of get it out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: And, I mean, try to drag it out of columns and figure that all out. Just one button doesn&#8217;t make that way easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise, you would have to drag and drop, for instance, three blocks instead of having a one button connection there. Yeah, yeah. You got it right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: That&#8217;s neat. Oh, and the next one, so the group block now has a variation picker in the placeholder. Which looks really, again, helpful being able to just choose the thing you want, the variation, in there, which is really handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I like it that this surface the row and the stack variation right when you select the group block not only when you have it already on your canvas and then on the right hand side, you need to figure out the layouts of that. So, yeah, I really like that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I think that that&#8217;s a quality of life thing right there. So you don&#8217;t have to insert the block and then get to the block and then go over to the right like what you&#8217;re saying. Just make this nice and easy. You want a row, you get a row. Two clicks, you&#8217;re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah. So the next one is under components, update the design of the focal point handle. What does that one look like? I think that&#8217;s&#8230; well, that&#8217;s nice. No, that&#8217;s nice. It&#8217;s like a little white circle with a little bit of opacity so you can see the stuff behind it. That&#8217;s super nice. I quite like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I love that people are actually taking the time and looking at these little&#8230; in a grand scheme WordPress, this is a tiny detail, but it just makes it that much nicer. It&#8217;s that little drop shadow, you can kind of see the image through it. I don&#8217;t know, that kind of stuff I&#8217;m always amazed because I don&#8217;t&#8230; I&#8217;m not a designer so I don&#8217;t look at things like that. If it was me, it&#8217;d be a big block, bright blue in there and it would look horrible but it would do the job. So it&#8217;s nice there&#8217;s this level of refinement happening to these existing tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. A good job on the designers and they really figure out all the alignment like when they redesigned the whole setting section or the style section on a block where you have two things in one row, they&#8217;re all line up nicely. That was in a second iteration but they now have a standard how to do that. So it&#8217;s really good. And the next one is the same qua&#8230; it&#8217;s also a quality of life thing, but it also speeds up your writing. You can convert paragraphs to headings with a keyboard shortcut and the keyboard shortcut…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Ctrl+Alt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Ctrl+Alt and then the number for the heading. So for H2, it&#8217;s Ctrl+Alt 2 and for three is&#8230; H3 is Ctrl+Alt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. If you&#8217;re on a Mac, I guess there&#8217;s options. So Ctrl+Options one to six.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Ctrl+Options, yes. Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Which is nice because I just learned that you can do that in Google Docs. So that&#8217;s a nice carryover here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. And I wish Google would carry over the paste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: The link? Were you going to say the link?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Link. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yes. Why does Google Docs not have that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It trips me up every time. Every time I have a link on a Google, it kind of trips me up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, I know. And I just end up pasting over top of the text that I just wrote because I want put a link on it. Hey, Google. Hey, Google, if you&#8217;re listening. I&#8217;m going to trigger everyone&#8217;s Google Home now by saying that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mine is downstairs so no problem with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. Oh, mine just triggered. I have one in the garage here and it just triggered. It just said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t hear what you&#8217;re saying.&#8221; Anyways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, ours, when it kind of gets triggered from something on the TV, it responds back in German. It&#8217;s so funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Oh, wow. Okay. Yeah. That&#8217;s funny.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, the home devices. Yeah. Okay. And the next one is really the following, the change in vocabulary. We don&#8217;t say full site editor anymore, we do just site editor. And that, of course, needs to come through the whole interface and some other documentation. I think we will follow it quite a bit, but sooner or later we will all be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s the same thing as trying not to call the Block Editor Site Editor Gutenberg, because Gutenberg&#8217;s the name&#8230; it&#8217;s the codename of the project, right? I know I&#8217;m very guilty of it just using it as a catchall tool. So I think this is just a matter of leading by example and having people, maybe not correcting everyone, but just kind of using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Oh, we talked about the minimum height on the dimensions already, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I think we did. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. But there&#8217;s also another design tool change or update. So on the right hand side, do you have the dimension controls and the spacing for padding and margin controls? And you notice when you go and change it in the step scale that it has a little visualizer around the block that you are editing in blue. And now that process also will hide the toolbar. So you really can concentrate on that block that you&#8217;re trying to place pixel perfect into your canvas. So I really like the spacing visualizer because I can never figure out is margin new outside or inside or is that padding outside on inside? So the visualizer really helps you with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> That is really nice. Yeah. On the global styles, they have some elements of adding a tech text decoration control to link elements. That&#8217;s nice. Being able to manage that. Very cool. Blue typography, adjust font size, min and max rules. That&#8217;s great. These are all interface items. They&#8217;re all being added to-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The theme JSON items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah. But are they adding controls for them as well like the one for the text link?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, the text … Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. And I think some of these are sort of&#8230; the other one we were talking about, the min height I believe that was more about&#8230; the first thing we talked about was allowing it to work and the second one was giving a sort of a control and some tooling around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And for fluid typography, I think they have started working on the interface or the user controls for it. But they&#8217;re right now only available through the theme JSON and they added minimum and maximum rules for the fun size. So you can actually change those, which was missing in 6.1 when the fluid topography came in the first time. And there is another global&#8230; so it&#8217;s also an attempt to see if you can generate random color palettes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s pretty neat for those that are having a hard time with the design that you can give a color and then it gives you additional colors that match that or kind of go well with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> That&#8217;s super neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. You don&#8217;t have to think about all the colors that you wanted to use. It&#8217;s really neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s really neat. I can just hear the agency folks going, &#8220;No.&#8221; But, yeah, being able to generate&#8230; that&#8217;s so neat. For someone like me who&#8217;s not a designer, who&#8217;s colorblind, being able to pick one color I like and then having sort of other complimentary colors generated for me, I think that&#8217;s really cool. It&#8217;s a really cool idea. Hopefully you can disable that for certain individuals or certain use cases I should say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I hope so too. It&#8217;s actually in the style variations. Those, you can shut down quite a bit. I&#8217;m just going through the PR and looking for &#8216;to disable this, do this&#8217; but I haven&#8217;t found it yet, but I&#8217;m also just scrolling through some of them. But those, okay, disable things will never be in the first iteration of a feature because you need to be pretty firm on how a feature works before you can say, &#8220;Okay, and now we disable it.&#8221; But given the history of whatever happened before, I think there&#8217;s a good chance that that will be added. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Definitely. So some bug fixes there. Play board is in both front end and editor. Well, that seems like a good thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that bug has been fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And other than that, I&#8230; or the Block Editor. So the list view has been updated to disable the branch expansion when a block editing is locked. So if you are not allowed to edit it or if you&#8217;re not allowed to move it or remove it and you can only edit the content, then it will not expand in the list view either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Right. So an example would be you&#8217;ve got a group block that you&#8217;ve locked and so you can&#8217;t see any of the nested blocks in there. You can&#8217;t expand that tree to see that. I think that&#8217;s really smart. I think that&#8217;s really smart because there&#8217;s a way of getting around locking and why clutter up the list view if you can&#8217;t&#8230; if you&#8217;ve got 100 blocks in there, it&#8217;s a very complicated pattern. You&#8217;ve inserted it, but why mess up the list view with stuff you can&#8217;t even edit in the first place? That&#8217;s my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah, yeah. Then we have some experiments. We didn&#8217;t have a whole lot of experiments for a long time, but at the beginning of the Gutenberg development, there were a few experiments where developers wanted to just see how things work. And we are back to that. The navigation list view is actually an experiment. And then also inspector based navigation editing is also an experiment. So when you install the Gutenberg plugin, you need to go down to the menu where it says Gutenberg and then go to the experiments settings page and then enable those so you can test them. Yeah. What else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: You want to move on the documentation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah, a lot of nice little documentation changes, changing titles around working with JavaScript in Gutenberg as opposed to just being&#8230; oh, and this is another Birgit thing here. So it&#8217;s not about getting started with JavaScript, it&#8217;s about how to use JavaScript in Gutenberg. It&#8217;s a fundamental difference because the assumption is that you do know how to use some JavaScript when coming to working with the Block Editor and Gutenberg Project and stuff like that. So I think it was a misnomer. So nice job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, there were quite a few posts in the community there where the PHP developer kind of started to figure out how that works with block development and all. And I saw if not twice, but three times that people didn&#8217;t get to that handbook section because of the title. It says How to Use JavaScript instead of &#8216;How to Use JavaScript With Gutenberg&#8217; or with WordPress is actually the title now. WordPress Block Editor. Of course they&#8217;re not saying Gutenberg, but I think that helps people who kind of read through the handbook to get to those pages much earlier in their discovery and also save them some headaches on their way to discover that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. I mean it&#8217;s much more discoverable now and I think that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And are you reorganized to create block documentation?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, yeah, yeah. We added another subsection. One of the things in the handbook is we have that massive left hand navigation that has accordions in it. And so for some of these packages, they can get quite lengthy those sections. So a while back, we worked on having the DocGen tool&#8230; so the DocGen tool is what generates the docs, but then get ingested into the Block Editor handbook from the Gutenberg repository. So we were working on ways of having sort of nested pages underneath those sort of subsections. And so that&#8217;s part of what one had done here. It&#8217;s great that it splits out to the available commands and kind of organizes that content a little bit better so it&#8217;s a little bit more palatable. Because, as we all know, the documentation in WordPress, there&#8217;s a zero to 100 thing. Here&#8217;s the basics and then here&#8217;s everything else you could ever need to know about it all on the same page. And that&#8217;s just hard to ingest and it&#8217;s hard to kind of parse through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by doing this, and we&#8217;ll be doing this to some other packages as well, I have a pull request in place that I have to finish for the scripts package that does the same thing. That kind of breaks out some of the more complicated things, more advanced things into their own pages because for the majority of users, they don&#8217;t need that. They just need to know what commands are available, for example. So, yeah, that&#8217;s the motivation behind this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s good kind of to go once in a while through documentation and do a little bit of an overhaul to update with the feedback from developers that have tried to insert information and say, &#8220;Okay. Well, it could be a little bit better.&#8221; So any improvement, you dear listeners, that you find or you couldn&#8217;t imagine, let us know on any places either WP Slack or a Twitter DM or on the Gutenberg Repo and we definitely are receptive to that and help out with making that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Absolutely. Many hands make light work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Many eyeballs, bugs are shallow. It&#8217;s the same with documentation. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Oh, okay. Yeah, totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Okay. So that&#8217;s all the documentation stuff we&#8217;re going to go through. And then what&#8217;s next? Code quality or patterns?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No. I think we are done a certain&#8230; yeah. Well, there is a view call&#8230;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: There&#8217;s a few things bolded in the code quality ones, but I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I actually bolded them to do some more research on it, but I didn&#8217;t get to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: I mean most of these things like the color palette, color box, kind of border box polish and dry prop types add default values. This is just making it easier to use the rename to .TS is for type script I guess. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s anything you want to specifically call it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. No, I don&#8217;t think we&#8230; there&#8217;s one change in the pattern directory API that it now supports pagination parameters, but that&#8217;s for Gutenberg developers or for contributors that use type into the pattern directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Oh, okay. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a public API. I wasn&#8217;t quite&#8230; oh, I think I was&#8230; yeah, I got the 401 kind of there not allowed, but I&#8217;m not quite sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s probably locked down. You probably have to be&#8230; well, no. Maybe. I don&#8217;t know. I have to look here. Anyways, it&#8217;s giving us pagination, which is great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So if you wanted to have more than 30 blocks or something like that so … No, it&#8217;s a 404 not found. So it&#8217;s kind of-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Okay. Yeah. So it&#8217;s locked down to somebody.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s locked down. All right, so that was the Gutenberg 14.6 release and now we are coming into section with what active development and discussions. And there are quite a few things that I find really, really exciting for the next iteration and I hope they make it all&#8230; there are still open PRs so you can test it. There is a different way how to test open PRs, but you get some great videos that demonstrate the features. So the first one is the design concepts for the browse method. So now that there are so many things that you can do in the site editor, the design team came up with how can we unify some of the interfaces. Some things are on the left column, some things are in the right column and can we have not all together, what about design?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they have some nice ideas where the global styles will be taken out of the right hand side, put them on the left hand side, have a design sub menu for the site editor. Also have a template sub menu for the site editor, but it&#8217;s all in one place. It&#8217;s not kind of fragmented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really nice. I&#8217;m just kind of scrolling through some of the design items in the ticket there. It looks great. The transitions that they have going, I just think it&#8217;s going to be really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And there&#8217;s also a browse mode. So when you click on the templates or page template, you see all the page templates in thumbnails. But they&#8217;re relatively big depending on your screen, but you see how they kind of can change when you change the style variation as well. So there&#8217;s a lot more &#8216;what you see is what you get.&#8217; And also kind of keeping a broader view on your site, especially when you do a lot of customizations on your templates to make it a little bit more consistent. Also show you things that are not consistent. So I think that really helps with the customization for site owners and those who actually build themes through the interface to have a better view on how this all looks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s one thing that I wanted to talk about. The other one is they&#8217;re working on a&#8230; and that&#8217;s more for the migration from classic themes to block themes that you can import widgets from the sidebar or that you&#8217;re using the sidebar that you can add them to block-based theme parts or template parts. And because the widget wasn&#8217;t available yet, there was a plugin available to add it to the site editor by Justin Tadlock called Classic Widgets. And this is the attempt to get it all into core, but that is definitely something to check out and see how that suits you. There&#8217;s not a whole lot of inter&#8230; yeah, there is a little video there on how to do that. So how it&#8217;s going to work, and I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah, this stuff&#8217;s so cool. It&#8217;s just amazing. I don&#8217;t know. That&#8217;s the stuff that they&#8217;re working on. I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know how to start that. I don&#8217;t even know how to build that.&#8221; But you all are doing a fantastic job doing all these cool things, so yeah. Glad I got out of development when I did because clearly I&#8217;m not qualified to do it anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s certainly something that&#8230; it&#8217;s for web developers that come from the &#8217;90s or early 2000s that kind of did all the database, the CSS, the HTML, the PHP, the JavaScript. I think it&#8217;s part of the times that you are not being expert in all of them as you were able to do in the early 2000s or mid 2000 or when WordPress came out with custom post types and you can do it all. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, another thing that working on is actually managing the font sets for the global styles typography and how you can kind of make them available to more than one block or kind of have the settings. Okay, I want those&#8230; you cannot go to every block and change the font family. You need some more general places where you can just click on things and then that applies that particular font family to that series of blocks. So you can kind of get this a little bit better. But that is really hard. When I look at the interfaces and all the design interfaces, you get a good feeling how hard that actually is to make this palatable for non code users to put it in an interface that&#8217;s not crowded, that&#8217;s not give you a lot of cognitive overload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: And isn&#8217;t developer jargon loaded. It&#8217;s hard to be able to communicate what a font face means or font weight. I know what that means as a developer, but if you&#8217;re not, then how do you explain how thick your letters are basically. It&#8217;s kind of how it is, right? Letter thickness. Maybe that&#8217;s how you do it. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ll leave that to the professionals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I mean the other interfaces like the text editors or like the Google Docs that have some of it, but then there is such a granular control that a theme developer would need as well that it kind of can really overload the things. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: For sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And one feature I really like is that to make it possible that you push a local block style to the global styles. You say, &#8220;Oh, I like this block how it is and that post that I just wrote and I wish all my blocks, my paragraph blocks or my image blocks would look that way.&#8221; Now they&#8217;re working on it that you can push that to the global styles and then all of a sudden every&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: So like reusable blocks, but for styles kind of?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For styles, yeah. Reuseable for styles kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah. So anytime you insert a paragraph block, you&#8217;d have that style available to you even if it wasn&#8217;t defined as part of your theme. I think that&#8217;s super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s super cool at the beginning when I think so. But if I think about, okay, how often do I change my mind? I said, &#8220;Oh, that could be really hard to kind of redo it.&#8221; Yeah, you want it on 15 blocks but not on 80 blocks kind of thing. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, yeah. That&#8217;s true. Maybe they&#8217;ll need an interface for editing those curated things where you edit the style and everything just gets automatically, but who knows? Who knows?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Sounds cool. Cool either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You need to explore that and if you tested and use it and then all of a sudden you see what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not working. Yeah. Now the other two really exciting as well. Do you want to take the first one or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Is that the pre-published one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah, so this one&#8217;s really cool. When you&#8217;re about to publish a post, if you have images that are external to the website. So if you imported a post from something and the URLs to your images are somewhere else, in the pre-published sidebar that says are you ready to publish, there&#8217;s a new panel being sort of suggested to be able to identify that you&#8217;ve got external images and give you the option to upload into your media library. I think that is such a handy thing. I know having done about a billion migrations that that&#8217;s a point of contention because it&#8217;s not easy to move those images programmatically. It can be done, but if you&#8217;ve imported stuff or copied and pasted and it&#8217;s there and you can just do it with a button, that&#8217;s so much simpler. I mean it&#8217;s not going to translate to doing 1000 posts all at once, but at least it&#8217;s such a nice feature. I think it&#8217;s so cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, it&#8217;s only for that particular page, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Yeah, yeah. Exactly. It&#8217;s not bulk uploading for the entire site, it&#8217;s for that specific page. Which I think is great. So cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I really like that. And there was always a restriction before. There was a button on each image block that said upload image, but that was kind of hit and miss as well. With Google Docs for instance, it worked, but it didn&#8217;t work with other WordPress sites or certain WordPress sites on certain servers. But Ella put some research on it and found how that can be consistently work better now with that tool as well. And there&#8217;s another PR open to copy that over to make that even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Right. Yeah. I think it&#8217;s really nice. On the issue that I&#8217;m sure will be linked in the show notes, there&#8217;s a nice little graphical representation of what that looks like. It&#8217;s nice and slick and just seems super easy. Yeah. The next one is&#8230; this has been merged. It&#8217;s going to be the next version of Gutenberg I believe, but it&#8217;s an experimental feature that&#8217;s&#8230; so it&#8217;s an experiment on the experiment. In the sidebar, this is going to split block sidebar controls into tabs, which I think is super neat. So being able to define settings for a block and appearance or styles or whatever you want to call it in separate tabs. So that&#8217;s pretty exciting. As a block developer, I&#8217;m pretty excited about being able to do that because I know that that sidebar gets really&#8230; with really complicated blocks that are doing lots of things, that sidebar gets really tall. Really, really big and you have to have all your panels come in and they&#8217;re collapsed by default. But being able to split them out in into tabs will make that a much better experience I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure about the technical implementation right now, but I would imagine though instead of just wrapping everything in inspector controls, you might have inspector control settings and inspector control appearance or whatever you want to call it. So, yeah, that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m excited about is I nerd out about that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I think it&#8217;s much easier also for a user to have that separate because sooner or later, you&#8217;re done with fiddling with the design of your site and now you&#8217;re putting content and you don&#8217;t have to touch those tires anymore or scroll past them all the time. So it&#8217;s really a good way to think about these things and put them in experiments so we all can experience them and kind of see what works and what doesn&#8217;t work out. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think what&#8217;s active in development is so exciting for me to look forward and I hope all of this makes it into 6.2. That&#8217;s the next major version and we don&#8217;t have a plan yet for 6.2 and I think sooner or later, it will come out. I know that Hector and some of the core contributors are working on it and figuring out what will be a good release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s definitely going to be not in 2022, so it&#8217;ll be February or March of 2023. And maybe even before. Maybe not WordCamp Asia, but after WordCamp Asia. Yeah. Oh, speaking of which, what we haven&#8217;t announced yet is the State of the Word. That&#8217;s before the end of the show and we are all on the end of the show. The State of the Word will be happening in New York and on livestream on December 15th at 1:00 PM Eastern, that&#8217;s 5:00 PM UTC or 17:00 UTC&#8230; No, 1:00 PM Eastern is plus five, it&#8217;s 18:00 UTC and 17:00 Central European Time. And we share the announcement post to the State of the Word on the news section in the show notes, so you can all make your reservations. There&#8217;s also a form that you can apply to actually come to the event in New York. It&#8217;s, again, in the Automattic office like last year and the Automattic office and SOHO office in New York City in Manhattan. It&#8217;s going to be pretty cool. It&#8217;s scheduled for one hour and a half, and normally that&#8217;s kind of half an hour presentation by Matt Mullenweg and Josepha together. And then Q&amp;A for another hour, both livestream and in-person. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Very cool. Nice. Exclusive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, it&#8217;s published already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher</em>: Oh. Well, then it&#8217;s not that exclusive. I just haven&#8217;t seen it. It&#8217;s exclusive to me, I just haven&#8217;t seen it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. As always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. Well, it&#8217;s hard today. Published on the gutenbergtimes.com/podcast and this is episode 76. And if you have questions or suggestions or news that you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. Yes, that&#8217;s an email address and that&#8217;s <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>. So thank you so much, Ryan. It was wonderful to have you. Do you have anything that you want our listeners to know that you haven&#8217;t talked about yet or how can people reach you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ryan Welcher:</em> Well, I don&#8217;t have any exclusive things to announce today, but you can find me online. I&#8217;m @RyanWelcher on Twitter. I am Welcher or Welcher Ryan or Ryan Welcher on basically every other piece of social media. My Twitch, you can check me out at RyanWelchercodes. And that&#8217;s the same name for my YouTube channel, which is also Ryan Welcher codes. And I think that&#8217;s probably it. But, yeah, I&#8217;d love to have everyone come and hang out with me on Thursdays 10:30 Eastern when I do my livestream. But thank you for having me, Birgit. I know. Love coming here and hanging out and talking to all this cool code stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it&#8217;s so wonderful to have you. Yeah. To talk through those things and have all your excitement for the Gutenberg developer. Custom development is such a nice addition to the Gutenberg Changelog.

The sting of the prospect of losing Twitter followers and the network that users worked to build, has underscored the importance of agency in social networking, the ability to take your data and connections with you to other networks on your own terms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although it is somewhat heartbreaking to see Twitter struggling to survive, one silver lining is that this situation is inspiring a drive towards a greater level of interoperability between apps, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/\">Tumblr engineers working to add ActivityPub support</a> so users can connect across Mastodon and other networks that use the same protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are steadily moving away from the all-powerful algorithms that steer consumers and subtly manipulate the public consciousness, and migrating away in search of healthier, more ethical social networking alternatives. The refreshing lack of ads and algorithms are winning people over in decentralized social networks, which are getting a second look from mainstream publications in light of Twitter&#8217;s loss of critical engineering teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m thankful for this renewed focus on networks that value the open web, where people are now exploring alternatives to walled gardens with their friends, instead of having to start over alone. Never underestimate the power of friction and crisis to refine how we communicate and motivate us to find a better way to stay connected. This is a moment that may have enough traction to change the course of social interaction on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With things changing all around, it&#8217;s heartening to know that  WordPress is still here and going strong, for those of us who have chosen it as the home for our content. We&#8217;re fortunate to have so many plugins available that connect our ecosystem to the broader web, allowing us to syndicate content to almost anywhere.  Let&#8217;s not miss this opportunity to dig into the open web and see where it takes us. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 21:06:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"Post Status: State of the Word 2022 • Dev Blog Beta • WP 3.7 – 4.0 Final Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=145071\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"https://poststatus.com/state-of-the-word-2022-dev-blog-beta-wp-3-7-4-0-final-releases/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17377:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-november-21-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (November 21, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">As 2022 comes to an end, State of the Word will happen in NYC again.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case making websites more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, well, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox. And use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Hannah Smith. Hannah is the operations and training manager for the Green Web Foundation, and founder of The Let&#8217;s Green The Web campaign. She&#8217;s also co-founder of Green Tech Southwest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her background is in computer science. She previously worked as a freelance WordPress developer and also for the Environment Agency, where she managed business change projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to forget that the device that you&#8217;re reading or listening to this podcast on is consuming power. We plug things in or charge them up, and they just work. They are sleek and sterile. No pollution comes out of the device directly. In fact, I&#8217;d go as far as to say that many of us never make the connection between our use of technology and the impact that this has on the environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Hannah Smith. She&#8217;s been thinking about this for years and is on the podcast today to highlight the issue and hopefully get your ideas about what users of WordPress can do to make sure that the websites we create are having the smallest impact possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her approach is not that we need to cease and desist using our technology. Rather it&#8217;s about coming up with new and innovative ways that we can reduce the impact that we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As creators of websites, there are a whole raft of options available to us. Reducing the size of our images. Inspecting the HTML to remove bloat. Choosing hosting options that source renewable energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, Hannah and others have been working on a sustainability related blog post, which has been published on the Make WordPress site this week. This post is intended to trigger meaningful and open discussion in the global WordPress community about the topic of sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She really wants to encourage others to weigh into this public conversation with their own thoughts, so that we can build on what is already happening to make WordPress more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating and thought provoking topic, and if you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can get all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Hannah Smith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Hannah Smith. Hello Hannah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Hello Nathan. Thank you so much for having me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You are so welcome. Hannah is here today to talk about the environmental impact of having WordPress websites, and I genuinely think this is going to be a real eye opener for many of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we do that though Hannah, we always orientate our listeners by allowing the guests to just give us a bit of background on who they are and what their relationship is with WordPress. So if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you that very generic question is just tell us a little bit about yourself and how come you are into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Thank you. I&#8217;m a massive fan of WordPress. I&#8217;ve so much love and admiration for the community. So my background is as a computer scientist, so that&#8217;s what I studied in my degree. Had, like many people, are very sort of winding interesting journey in and around different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And about eight years ago, I set myself up as a freelance WordPress developer. So having done sort of other careers within tech, I won&#8217;t give you the long winding path that I got there, but serendipity basically somehow landed me, as a freelance WordPress developer. Finding myself wanting to give it a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was living in Bristol at the time, and wanted to learn more about WordPress and found that we had a meetup community in Bristol, and decided to pop along. Was made to feel very welcome, and learn loads from the awesome people there. So, a shout out to Simon, Janice, and Rob, who were the people that grounded me into that community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it wasn&#8217;t long before I somehow found myself invited to help run that community and help drive that community, which I was very happy to do for a good few years. And then in 2019 we did WordCamp Bristol. We had about 200 odd people come to that, which was brilliant. And I&#8217;ve been quite involved in WordCamps and speaking at conferences. Try and contribute where I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These days I&#8217;ve actually hung up my shoes, only recently as a WordPress developer, and I&#8217;ve transitioned to working full-time for the Green Web Foundation. But part of my role at the Green Web Foundation, so I do a lot of training and outreach and operations, because we&#8217;re small, so everyone wears lots of hats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do also manage our WordPress website as well and our WordPress estate too. So, whilst it might not be my full job title to have WordPress every single day, it is still very much a part of what I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. What a, rich and interesting history you&#8217;ve had. We&#8217;ve met in person on a number of occasions, but it&#8217;s been a little while since we met up in person. But you came across my radar on the 1st of November because of a piece that you had written over on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will link to it in the show notes and, it may well be a good idea, if you&#8217;re listening to this podcast and you are anywhere near a device, it might be a good idea to pause the podcast actually. Go and read the piece it&#8217;s called, now we have a sustainability channel in making WordPress Slack, what should we do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the reason I&#8217;m asking you to potentially go and read that is because really it&#8217;s going to form the basis of everything that we are going to be talking about around the environment and so on. So tell us what was the concern? What was the primary motive for writing that piece?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:25] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> So, the piece was written very much in collaboration with four others, so I want to say from the outset that whilst it was my face next to the post when you read it, I was the nominated person to publish it. It was very much a collaborative effort with four others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with Nora, Nahuai, Pace, and Csaba, who are placed in different places across Europe. And, Nahuai and Nora, I knew from some workshops I&#8217;d run back in the spring, exploring the topic of digital sustainability. But we were chatting and we all felt that where was the action in WordPress on sustainability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were kind of looking around and, I&#8217;m very involved in the wider community around digital sustainability. But I was looking around and I was like, I just don&#8217;t feel this in WordPress. It&#8217;s just not surfaced enough. It&#8217;s very niche and, we are really getting to a point where sustainability can&#8217;t be a niche concern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has to be a concern for everybody, everywhere because what&#8217;s happening around us in terms of the changing climate, in terms of our lack of sustainable approaches, does affect every single person, whether they want to admit that or not. We are all impacted by it. Rich, poor, young, old, we&#8217;re all going to face these consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we were chatting and Nora and Nahuai I were at WordCamp Europe this year, and Nora actually asked a question in, you know the Q and A that Josepha and Matt have? So Nora asked a question about sustainability and  stood up. I mean more power to her. She stood up in front of the whole crowd and said, hey, sustainability. We really care about this, but there&#8217;s nothing much happening, and Matt and Josepha said, well, okay, look. The very first thing we can do is set up a channel in Slack. So maybe that will help, WordPress Slack. You know to give people a collaboration space and a meeting space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they also said, well, and if you&#8217;ve got any ideas or specific proposals that you want to make, we are going to listen. The door is open, essentially. So Nora set this ball in motion really with her question. And then Josepha and Matt responded really well. And so since then, since the summer, a few of us have been sort of working, just informally, thinking, okay, well how do we capitalize upon this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress leadership is saying we&#8217;re listening, or, we are happy to collaborate with you. But now what we need to do is to get the community together and to get the community, A, to know who each other are, and B, to acknowledge this is a topic and to talk about it, and discuss it, and bring knowledge and ideas into a space together. So this is why we ended up writing the post. And the post is very much saying, hey, WordPress community, look, we&#8217;ve got this channel, but you know, a channel isn&#8217;t going to solve our problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s you. You and your ideas that are going to solve these problems or that are going to make progress. So, could we please get into a discussion about what people&#8217;s ideas are? So we&#8217;ve invited people to share their ideas and particularly any vision that they have. Or ideas that they have around what sustainability and WordPress might look like in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because if we can&#8217;t imagine it, we&#8217;re not going to get there. And I think a lot of the narrative around climate change is very doom and gloom. It&#8217;s very pessimistic. It feels almost like we&#8217;re accepting that we&#8217;ve been defeated. opposite. It&#8217;s so the opposite. We have every opportunity and potential here to turn things around and change things. It is not yet too late. So we wanted to really bring everyone together and imagine these ideas together and then see where that leads us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. That&#8217;s really helpful. You used the word sustainable a dozen times or more in, in that, last little section, and it occurs to me that there&#8217;s probably quite a few people listening who have some sort of conception of what we mean by sustainability, but I&#8217;m pretty sure that everybody&#8217;s conception of it will be slightly different to everybody else&#8217;s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What exactly are you meaning when you say sustainability in WordPress or sustainability surrounding WordPress? What are the areas that you are touching on? What are the points of concern that we need to have drawn to our attention?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:54] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s a great question. You are absolutely right that most people will have slightly differing ideas of sustainability. Some people may even have a very narrow view of sustainability, which might be something called decarbonization. Which really relates around carbon emissions. But, Perhaps let me give a really sort of wide view of what sustainability is outside of the realms of tech or WordPress, and then we can kind of narrow in a bit and talk about how that relates then to tech or digital specifically, or WordPress specifically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we talk about sustainability or the word sustain, it means that we&#8217;re able to keep doing things into the long term. There&#8217;s this quote that&#8217;s often used. It&#8217;s about meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs, or the ability of the future generations to meet their needs. So at it&#8217;s most basic level, sustainability can mean that. To get a bit more specific about it, I draw on something called the donor economics framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anybody here is interested in a really holistic way of thinking about sustainability, that&#8217;s a bit more in depth, I really recommend this as a resource to have a look at. Very accessible. Don&#8217;t let the fact that it&#8217;s about economics or economics turn you away, make you think it&#8217;s not for you. It is for everybody. And the way that donor economics talks about sustainability, I really love this is, it talks about sustainability as having humanity at the center of the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So sustainability is much more than us thinking about the environmental ecosystems. It&#8217;s about thinking about how humanity sits within the environment. So if you can imagine a simple donut shape with a hole in the middle. Essentially what you get there is two circles, one smaller one inside, a bigger one. That smaller circle, we might often think of something that they term as the social foundation. And the social foundation is a set of 12 things that, when you consider them all in relation to one another, define the things that makes us human, and defines the things that just allow us to survive as humans, but allows us to really thrive as humans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s more than just thinking about food, water, shelter, clothing. It&#8217;s also thinking about those emotional needs that we have as well around peace and justice. Around meaningful connections with other people around access to education and opportunities. So I love to think about our social foundation as the center of the story of sustainability. Because humans are a part of this planet. And it is a very dangerous mindset, or a very dangerous kind of thing to get into, to think that the only way that we become more sustainable is by not being here. And that&#8217;s really not a good story to tell, and it&#8217;s not the right story to tell. We are part of the planet, and we can live within the boundaries of what the planet can provide for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that moves me onto the second circle, this outer circle. And donor economics talks about that as our ecological boundaries or our ecological ceiling. And that&#8217;s basically accepting that the planet has a finite amount of resources. There&#8217;s only so much wind that blows. There&#8217;s only so many raw materials in the ground. There&#8217;s only so much accessible water, drinkable water. There&#8217;s only so much land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps us understand that we have these boundaries in place. We have these limitations. So when we talk about sustainability, or when I&#8217;m talking personally talking about sustainability, I&#8217;m thinking about those concepts. I&#8217;m thinking about humanity being at the center of the planet. Being at the center of our concerns, but I&#8217;m also thinking that humanity has to live within these constraints that the world places upon us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in donor economics, if you have that donut shaped circle, if I&#8217;m hoping everyone listening can picture it or maybe you&#8217;ve looked it up online. If you&#8217;ve got this kind of circle, what you have is, the way the donor economics talks about it is we talk about sustainability as being this sweet spot in the middle where we are meeting everybody&#8217;s needs to thrive. But we are doing that within the boundaries of the planet. And that it is absolutely possible that we can have nice things and that we can be happy, healthy, joyful humans, but that we can live within the means of our planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me, sustainability is that broad concept. And I&#8217;m just going to stop there, Nathan, because I know we haven&#8217;t actually talked about this before and I&#8217;m curious to know, how that resonates with you, as a definition of sustainability or as a way of thinking about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:05] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I fully understand where you are coming from. I guess the piece that I&#8217;m confronted with is that, I always think of, how to describe this. I very often think of conservation and I think about it in terms of we&#8217;ve got to do less things. We&#8217;ve got to drive the car less. We&#8217;ve got to consume less electricity, we&#8217;ve got to get on planes less. We&#8217;ve got to produce less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the environmental debate always, for me at least anyway, comes back to reducing what we&#8217;re doing and kind of admitting to ourselves that the aspirations that we seem to have as a species, to rampantly consume everything and believe that we are fully in charge of everything on the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels as if we need to put the breaks on and actually, rather than that, we need to go in reverse. We need to, like I said, produce less things, consume less things. It sounds as if you&#8217;ve got a slightly different philosophy there, which is we&#8217;ve just got to figure out how we can carry on the way we are. But with cleverer solutions so that the things that we create, the plane journeys that we go on, the cars that we drive. All of that&#8217;s still possible, but we need to figure out how the impact of that would be lessened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:28] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Almost, yeah. That&#8217;s almost what I&#8217;m saying, but not quite. If we think about what we&#8217;re driving our cars for. What we are flying for. What are we doing these things for? It might be that the mechanism by which we create connection with one another or that we get from A to B, or that we see our family and friends, or that we have meaningful relationships with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might be that those things are done differently. And yeah, so it might mean that we reduce car use. We reduce airplane flights. But that doesn&#8217;t mean we don&#8217;t replace it with other things. Technology is amazing. I mean, look at, look at the internet. It&#8217;s absolutely incredible what digital technology enables us to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the story of sustainability, it&#8217;s very, very important to not get drawn into this narrative that we&#8217;ve all got to live like cave people, which is so often what people think being sustainable means. It means giving up all the things that bring us joy and bring us meaning in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And actually, I don&#8217;t buy that at all. I think that that is the wrong way to look at sustainability. I actually think what living in a truly sustainable way means is reducing the things that don&#8217;t give us those joyful things. Don&#8217;t provide meaningful connection in our life, and replacing them with the things that do. And do you know what? What&#8217;s amazing is that the things that genuinely, meaningfully do improve our lives, are generally sustainable, at the same time. Like riding a bike, walking, exercising, spending less time on social media, perhaps doing more time crafting or reading a book. Those things do all actually add to our lives, add to our happiness, add to our, you know, meaning and purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s a really important starting point just to say to the WordPress community, hey, look, being sustainable doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re going to lose all these things that we love. In fact, we are going to lose the things that don&#8217;t service and replace them with better, better, more meaningful things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. One of the things that I find tricky is I don&#8217;t really equate my use of the internet with the environmental consequences that there are from my use of the internet. Before we hit record, I was talking to you, I described how the technology that I&#8217;m using, so I&#8217;ve got a computer in front of me, I have a mobile phone. Unless I actually apply thought, my default in a way, is that they are completely benign and harmless. Typically, if I&#8217;m using my mobile phone say, there&#8217;s not really any part of me which is consciously thinking, okay, for every minute that I spend on this phone, there&#8217;s a consequence to this. There&#8217;s an environmental impact. I&#8217;m consuming electricity. That phone needed to be charged, and the same would go for any device, any piece of technology, any website that I visit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just not bridging that gap. Whereas other things, so for example, the driving of the car. I&#8217;m acutely aware of the consequences of that because there&#8217;s things actually coming out of the rear of that car through the exhaust system that I can detect. I can feel the harm from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know? There&#8217;s no way that if you told me to go and stand behind a car for 10 minutes and breathe in deeply. There&#8217;s no way that that&#8217;s going to be something that I wish to do. I can draw a, a line between the stuff that&#8217;s coming out the exhaust, and my health and lungs, I can completely understand that. Whereas the phone, like I said, is completely benign. I could do that for hours, and so, I do think it&#8217;s an interesting thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder if you sense that generally speaking. When you have these discussions and you are trying to encourage people to equate internet use, technology use, whatever it may be, with the consequences of that, I&#8217;m wondering if people are generally, they&#8217;re open to it, they understand it, they draw that line themselves immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or is there a bit of, what, hang on a minute. I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;m going to have to apply some thought to this. What do you mean? How can my, how can my computer possibly be doing any harm?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:53] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> oh yeah, it&#8217;s such a good point. I mean, I can speak from my own experience as someone that has always been really interested in the environment, and really conscious of sustainability, environmentalism. And it wasn&#8217;t until I went to WordCamp Europe, when it was in Berlin actually, and Jack Lenox was giving a talk and Jack Lenox&#8217;s talk was, are website&#8217;s killing the planet? Something along those lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had this like total mad aha moment where I was like, oh my God, right? Digital tech runs on electricity. Has to be built. All that stuff&#8217;s got to come from somewhere. So of course it has an impact. But it wasn&#8217;t until I heard Jack&#8217;s talk, and also around the same sort of time, I heard Whole Grain Digital talking as well, I put two and two together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s funny, but once, as soon as someone told me, oh yeah, you are using electricity to run this stuff. And of course electricity is mostly coming from the burning of fossil fuels, and all this stuff has to be manufactured. So all the lithium and cobalt, gold and silver and all the stuff that&#8217;s in your phone all has to come from somewhere. And that&#8217;s really energy intensive and damaging to create, or extract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as I was given that little push in the right direction, suddenly this whole cascade of implications unfolded in front of me, and I was like, oh, well, yeah obviously, now I see it. But I, like many people, I think just need to be given that little nudge. Really helps to hear someone say that explicitly. Hey, did you know that between, see if I can get the numbers right. 1.9 and 3.3% of the world&#8217;s global greenhouse gas emissions arise from our use of digital tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that that&#8217;s more than shipping and more than aviation? Did you know that that actually means that the internet becomes the world&#8217;s seventh biggest polluter is a country? When you start to hear those things, yeah, it dawns on you. And that&#8217;s certainly how I came into this space, or certainly how I kind of realized this for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe many people listening to what I&#8217;ve just said, the light bulbs have just flicked on as well and gone, oh right, yeah, of course, good point. It&#8217;s unseen, isn&#8217;t it, this pollution? To your point earlier, it&#8217;s all been abstracted away from us, so that we have clean, convenient lives. As you rightly say, you know, our phones are really sleek. Our laptops are really sleek. And that&#8217;s part of the service I suppose, that we&#8217;re being provided. We&#8217;re being given this convenience. We&#8217;re being given beautiful, well designed things. But that impact, unfortunately, is still very real at the moment. Maybe in time to come, we&#8217;ll get to a place where it&#8217;s not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll have some new technologies that perhaps use the regenerative techniques, where we&#8217;re not extracting materials from the ground. Maybe we can start to grow them or find other ways to create them. But right now, yeah, that impact is real. Whoever came up with the term cloud really like clever, but from a sustainability angle, not helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:15] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s about the most benign thing imaginable, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s fluffy and, welcoming and, you know, they&#8217;re associated with the sun and all of that. Yeah, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:24] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Yeah, and it&#8217;s just not true. Like actually it&#8217;s like a big diesel plume. To your point, actually the reality is 62% of the world&#8217;s energy, electricity comes from fossil fuel sources. And we can think about it as the internet is actually the world&#8217;s largest coal fired machine. When you start to have those pictures in your head, it does change your relationship to what you&#8217;re doing and what you have in front of you a bit I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> And I guess that&#8217;s really the purpose of what it is that you are doing in the article that you wrote. Is you are, you&#8217;re keenly aware of this. It&#8217;s obviously something which is meaningful to you on a personal level. And you are, you&#8217;re really scouting out for ideas and suggestions and, for the community to gather around, and come up with what we can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, let&#8217;s lay out a few things in terms of WordPress. These are the things which just come into my mind as we&#8217;re sitting here talking to one another. I confess that there isn&#8217;t a great deal of backstory here. I&#8217;m just going to generate things as they come up into my mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first thing is that our website&#8217;s dependent upon what is being presented to the end user. So, you know, if it&#8217;s a, if it&#8217;s a website, which is rich in large images. If it&#8217;s a website which is rich in video. If it&#8217;s a website which has huge amounts of JavaScript and CSS. We are pushing more bits over the wire. And so maybe there&#8217;s a piece there. Can we cut down the amount that WordPress needs to do, and needs to deliver?Would that have an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:00] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:02] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. And then another thing which comes into my head is, at the end of the day when I finish with my computer, the last thing I do is I switch it off. I turn it off, and then when I need it again, I&#8217;ll switch it on and I&#8217;ll, whenever I&#8217;ve finished I turn it off again, so it&#8217;s on, off, on, off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is that it&#8217;s off more than It&#8217;s on. Significantly more. But our website hosting, let&#8217;s just call it that, wherever that might be, whatever system you are using. We need that to be on all the time because our websites need to be available all the time. That&#8217;s one of the points is something which is, you know, you don&#8217;t have to go to a website and be visited by a page which says, one moment, we&#8217;re just going to switch the computer on, and come back in a moment and everything will be ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, you want it to be ready immediately. And in fact, we&#8217;re being told all the time that the faster our webpage is being served up, the better it&#8217;s going to do in search engine rankings, which is almost like a holy grail. So everything needs to be quicker and everything needs to be more available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s just a couple of pieces there really, which came to my head, the first one being that can we reduce the amount that WordPress has to serve up, and will that have a positive effect? And obviously that very much feels like a seesaw. You could argue that from both sides. But also the machines that our websites are running on, there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of conversations that we could have around there. The kind of things that hosting companies are doing to source the power and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:30] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s brilliant, isn&#8217;t it? You start to think about these things and you&#8217;ve hit upon two real, really key actionable things that we can look at within WordPress. So we&#8217;re talking at the moment about electricity and energy use, and I&#8217;m just going to sort put this into context and say, hey, don&#8217;t forget that electricity and energy use is just one aspect of sustainability. There is a little bit more to it than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do think that when you are brand new to thinking about the impact of digital tech on sustainability, this is an absolutely awesome starting point. It&#8217;s very tangible and there&#8217;s quite a bit of research and tooling out there to help you. So I just want to kind of caveat and say, let&#8217;s deep dive into that for a little bit, awesome. But bear in mind, there&#8217;s more to think about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a very direct relationship between the amount of data that you send and the amount of CO2 emissions that that creates. So the more data to use your words, the more data, the more stuff you&#8217;re sending down the wire, the more pollution or the more energy that you&#8217;re using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s a simple way to calculate this. For anyone that wants to get into this. If you know how much data you are sending, we can estimate how much electricity that is going to use to send that data from A to B. Whole load of assumptions that you&#8217;ll have to make in order to make that estimation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s some models out there that you can use. You can have a look at the sustainable web design website. So if you know how much data you&#8217;ve got, you can figure out an estimation of how much electricity that would use to send from A to B. And then we can use something called carbon intensity data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And carbon intensity data allows us to understand how much CO2 emissions are created per unit of energy, or per unit of electricity that is created. So I mentioned to you that 62% of the worlds electricity is generated by fossil fuels. In different countries, and in different regions that will change. So I think Norway, for example, is 100% renewable energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So depending on where you are in the world, you&#8217;ll have different carbon intensities to consider. But yeah, so essentially it can come down, a really good starting point is to think about performance and optimization, and think about how can I reduce the waste around this. There are dozens of reasons why we should be thinking about performance anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a new ask of developers, or ask of technical people to think about performance. We have reasons around accessibility. We have reasons around cost. We also have reasons around SEO as well. The more performant and optimize something is, the better your SEO. And we also have things to think about in terms of people&#8217;s enjoyment of using said service, or said website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we can add another one, another cracking good reason to think about this optimization and performance, and that is also the sustainability angle. So, I mean, really this stuff is just stacking up and stacking up to be like a no brainer. If you want to be a sustainable web developer, your first job is to get good at performance and optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It&#8217;s interesting, the whole performance thing, while you were talking about that, I was thinking about the fact that performance really can go in two directions. The performance could be gained by cutting out waste, but it can also be gained by using more resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:05] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Ha ha, yes, good shout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:07] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It is possible to simply say to yourself, I shall purchase more expensive hosting, which has got more CPUs and so on and so forth. And in that way, I cut out the need for me to make my website leaner, if you know what I mean. So, just to be clear, when you talk about performance, you really are talking about getting rid of the waste, considering whether that image needs to be that big or could it be smaller? Do I need to put that video on there? It&#8217;s more trimming things down as opposed to spending more money on a faster machine for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:39] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Interesting point. I&#8217;m really glad we&#8217;re having this conversation. Yes and no I would answer that question. 100% the yes part is definitely around the waste. Is around just not sending stuff we don&#8217;t need. Not having analytics collecting that we don&#8217;t need. Not generating data that we don&#8217;t need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resources part is a really interesting one, because there&#8217;s a piece around maybe using our resources more wisely. So there can be arguments for perhaps having better hosting. Because if that better hosting, say you are serving a website across, you&#8217;ve got users all across the world visiting your website. Actually having a better hosting service that makes really good use of CDNs, content delivery networks, actually can have an impact on sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because if you are serving your data closer to the person that actually wants to use that data, you can save quite a bit of energy, electricity, because you&#8217;re not sending it from one side of the world to the other. And there is an electricity cost to doing that. Again, it&#8217;s not seen by us, but it&#8217;s real. It is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the service side, the hosting side of things. Something very specific you can do there is look for hosting companies that are using renewable energy, using renewable energy sources to power themselves. And I&#8217;m going to plug the Green Web Foundation where I&#8217;m working now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a really awesome data set, which we&#8217;ve been collecting for 10 years or so on hosting companies that are powered by renewables. That&#8217;s a very specific action you can take. But yeah, to your point that you can make something really performant by chucking loads of resources at it. Yeah, that&#8217;s not what we are talking about here when we are talking about sustainability. We are talking about speeding things up through the use of wise resources instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:36] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I know that time is pressing for you, so we&#8217;ll wrap up fairly shortly, but I just want to, just want to offer a few thoughts as well, and, the piece that I mentioned towards the beginning of the podcast where I said that, it&#8217;s very difficult I think for me, and I&#8217;m sure a lot of other people as well, to draw the line between the website and the impact on the environment, and I&#8217;m wondering if it might be that we need to be alerted to the consequences of our use of the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just throwing out some ideas, which probably, may very well have no legs, but just some thoughts really. Would be interesting, for example, if in the WordPress backend we could see something which gave us a measure of what it was that our website was doing. So if it gave us a direct link to okay, every, every time somebody comes to this particular page, this is what you are sending to them, and that has this kind of consequence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, obviously, that&#8217;s much more complicated, as you&#8217;ve described, because it depends on the hosting that you&#8217;re using. It depends whether they&#8217;re close or far away. But just some sort of broad metrics so that we could understand what the consequence of the thing that we&#8217;re building is. So I don&#8217;t even know what that would look like. Maybe it would be some sort of graph or chart or just raw number that would give us some indication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then also more broadly, just browsing the internet. If we could have this kind of information coming back to us. So, I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m thinking of like a browser extension or something like that, which would measure what it was that I was doing when I went around the internet, and then give me some kind of feedback for, okay, this week you consumed this much in terms of electricity or carbon that was produced as a result of your browsing the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week it was this, the week before it was this, so you know you&#8217;re going in the right direction. Just those kind of things. I&#8217;m just wondering if there are things afoot. Maybe tools that exist already, or projects that you know about that can help us to understand the consequences of what we are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:39] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Definitely, and do you know what Nathan? These ideas absolutely have legs and these are exactly the kind of ideas that we are inviting people to come and share on our post with us. All of these suggestions, all of these ideas are relevant and very, very actionable, and have already been actioned in certain ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to your point about CO2, understanding CO2 emissions of websites, so there&#8217;s a fantastic tool called Website Carbon Calculator. I think the URL is websitecarbon.com. So you can go along to that and put any URL in, and immediately get a sense of how polluting that page is. And that is such an awesome tool to use with bosses or clients, who perhaps aren&#8217;t so interested in the nitty gritty technical detail, but want a number, or a statistic or a sense of how good or bad they&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Website Carbon Calculator has a little bit of JavaScript code that you can embed in your site that will give you a reading of each page of how much CO2 that that page is polluting. Now I believe that there is a plugin for that as well, and I don&#8217;t know if that would give you the information in the back end of WordPress, but Website Carbon Calculator&#8217;s being developed by Whole Grain Digital. If you&#8217;re interested in WordPress sustainability, I mean, they&#8217;re really thought leaders in this space, so definitely worth checking them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had some conversations with Jenny Wong many years ago, and, and those of you that are in the UK WordPress community, you&#8217;ll probably know Jenny. I think most people do. And if you&#8217;re listening, Jenny, hello. Jenny and I exchanged some ideas around using Site Health, and actually building some of these ideas into Site Health. That section of the WordPress backend. It might be difficult to get that as a core contribution to begin with, but we could certainly look at making some plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s loads and loads of data out there that we could use to surface these emissions. And then to your point about browsers, yes. Actually at the Green Web Foundation, we&#8217;ve been talking quite a lot with the Firefox people, made by Mozilla. And there are some open issues in GitHub at the moment around integrating carbon emission readings and estimations into the Firefox browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know off the top of my head whether the intention would be to track it in the way that you&#8217;ve talked, but you know how if you&#8217;re a developer, you, you might be familiar with the web dev tooling that we have, say within Firefox or Chrome. The idea is to create a separate tab in the performance section, to start to give you a reading within the browser as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are all these things happening, and this is where I really want to invite people to come and join us. Please let us share these initiatives that are happening. If you&#8217;ve got some time and capacity and you&#8217;ve got some energy, and you want to take action, we desperately want people to come and join in, and make these things happen. So yeah, please share these ideas that you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:49] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you. Yeah, that&#8217;s really, really interesting. Just before we wrap it up finally, it just occurs to me that we&#8217;re always looking for ways to, to have a competitive edge. If you are a freelancer or an agency, you&#8217;re always trying to figure out ways that you are different from your competition. And it just strikes me that maybe this, maybe this could be one of those ways. You are one of the developers who actually gives this some thought. And it may very well be that there are a whole load of clients out there for whom this would be a very important metric when making hiring decisions, so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:24] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Such a good point. As a freelance WordPress developer, uh, you know, people were, were starting to know me as someone who knew about digital sustainability and who could build sustainable WordPress sites, you know, efficient WordPress sites. And the demand was mad. I couldn&#8217;t keep up with it. I was constantly being like, oh, I need more people to recommend this work to. So yeah, I think this is a really strong selling point, and it makes you feel good as well, to know that you&#8217;re doing the best you can, you&#8217;re doing the right things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:55] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Hannah, just as a very final thing. If people have been interested in this, I will obviously link to the post in the show notes. You can check those out on wptavern.com, but if they want to contact you, are you available? And if so, where should we do that? What&#8217;s the best way to reach out to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:12] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Yeah, well, I mean, I would love to chat with anyone that&#8217;s interested in bouncing some ideas around, or is interested in finding out more. The best way to get hold of me is through the Green Web Foundation, so hannah@thegreenwebfoundation.org, or if you&#8217;re in make WordPress you can also drop me a line. You&#8217;ll see me lurking around in the sustainability channel quite a lot in the make WordPress Slack space. You can drop me a line there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Hannah Smith, thank you very much for joining us on the podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:41] <strong>Hannah Smith:</strong> Oh, thank you Nathan. Thank you for making time for this today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hanopcan/\">Hannah Smith</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hannah is the Operations and Training Manager for the <a href=\"https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/\">Green Web Foundation</a> and founder of the <a href=\"https://climateaction.tech/projects/letsgreentheweb-campaign/\">Let’s Green The Web campaign</a>. She’s also co-founder of <a href=\"https://greentechsouthwest.org/\">Green Tech South West</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her background is in Computer Science. She previously worked as a freelance WordPress developer, and also for the Environment Agency, where she managed large business change projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s pretty easy to forget that the device that you’re reading this post on is consuming power. We plug things in or charge them up, and they just work. They are sleek and sterile. No pollution comes out of the device directly. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that many of us never make the connection between our use of technology and the impact this has on the environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Hannah Smith. She’s been thinking about this for years and is on the podcast today to highlight the issue, and hopefully get your ideas about what users of WordPress can do to make sure that the websites we create are having the smallest impact possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her approach is not that we need to cease and desist using our technology. Rather, it’s about coming up with new and innovative ways that we can reduce the impact that we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As creators of websites, there are a whole raft of options available to us. Reducing the size of our images. Inspecting the HTML to remove bloat. Choosing hosting options that source renewable energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this in mind, Hannah and others have been working on a sustainability related <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/11/01/sustainability-channel-what-should-we-do/#comment-162\">blog post</a> which has been published on the Make WordPress site this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is intended to trigger meaningful and open discussion in the global WordPress community about the topic of sustainability. She really wants to encourage others to weigh into this public conversation with their own thoughts, so we can build on what is already happening to make WordPress more sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a fascinating and thought-provoking topic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/\">The Green Web Foundation website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://climateaction.tech/projects/letsgreentheweb-campaign/\">#Let&#8217;sGreenTheWeb Campaign</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wholegraindigital.com/\">Wholegrain Digital website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sustainablewebdesign.org/\">Sustainable Web Design website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.websitecarbon.com/\">Website Carbon Calculator</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 11.0.0 to Limit JavaScript and CSS Asset Loading to Community Pages Using a Filter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=139798\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-11-0-0-to-limit-javascript-and-css-asset-loading-to-community-pages-using-a-filter\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3241:\"<p>BuddyPress will soon be <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2022/11/21/buddypress-will-soon-only-load-its-javascript-and-style-assets-into-the-community-area-of-your-site/\">improving the way it loads its JavaScript and CSS assets</a> so that they are only loaded on community pages. Previously, the plugin would load them indiscriminately on every page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress lead developer Mathieu Viet said he&#8217;s not sure there is a specific reason explaining why this was kept in place. Before the plugin <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2013/04/buddypress-1-7-is-now-available/\">introduced the BP Theme Compat API</a> in version 1.7, it was necessary to use a BuddyPress compatible theme like the one bundled by default (<a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/BP-Default\">BP Default</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think we kept the way this theme was loading these assets into the first Template Pack (BP Legacy) we added to BuddyPress,&#8221; Viet said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users have often requested BuddyPress only load its assets on community pages in hopes of further optimizing their websites. For example, in 2020, a user on the BuddyDev forums <a href=\"https://buddydev.com/support/forums/topic/how-to-load-buddypress-scripts-styles-only-on-buddypress-pages/\">requested custom code</a> to accomplish this. Experts recommended against doing it</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It is not going to help you much and will cause a lot of issues in future,&#8221; BuddyPress contributor Brajesh Singh said. &#8220;There are dependent plugins which may start throwing JavaScript errors and breaking some of your site functionality. It is not worth the effort.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singh recommended the user enable browser caching to avoid loading the assets multiple times and stick to best practices for enabling gzip compression and other optimization measure. He also recommended adding a plugin that would conditionally prevent loading BuddyPress on certain pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming in version 11.0.0, BuddyPress core will progressively move towards loading only the assets it needs in community areas. This update will still load JS and CSS everywhere but will offer a filter that users can add to their <a href=\"https://codex.buddypress.org/themes/bp-custom-php/\">bp-custom.php</a> files in order to keep BP assets on community pages only:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>add_filter( &#8216;bp_enqueue_assets_in_bp_pages_only&#8217;, &#8216;__return_true&#8217; );</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If using the above filter, you notice something is going wrong with your website due to the use of a specific BP plugin or theme, <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">report it here</a> and we’ll then have another development cycle to fix things before we completely restrict these assets to BuddyPress generated pages in a second step in version 12.0.0,&#8221; Viet said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 11.0.0 is expected to be released on December 14, 2022. Early adopters and BuddyPress site owners who have always wished for the plugin to behave this way can take advantage of it after the next major update using the filter. The filter can also be easily removed if users are troubleshooting and having issues with plugins. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:28:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: New Tool Checks If Google Fonts Are Hosted Locally\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=139780\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/new-tool-checks-if-google-fonts-are-hosted-locally\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3462:\"<p>Earlier this year, WordPress&#8217; Themes Team began urging theme authors to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-strongly-urges-theme-authors-to-switch-to-locally-hosted-webfonts\">switch to locally hosted fonts</a> after a German court case decision, which <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/german-court-fines-website-owner-for-violating-the-gdpr-by-using-google-hosted-fonts\">fined a website owner for violating the GDPR by using Google-hosted webfonts</a>. Since that ruling, German website owners have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/de_EDV/comments/xm6803/abmahnung_bzgl_dsgvoversto%C3%9F_wg_angeblicher/\">continued to receive threats of fines</a> for not having their fonts hosted locally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The makers of the <a href=\"https://fontsplugin.com/\">Fonts Plugin</a>, a commercial product with a free version on WordPress.org, have created a tool called <a href=\"https://fontsplugin.com/google-fonts-checker/\">Google Fonts Checker</a> that will help website owners discover where their fonts are hosted. The tool analyzes any URL entered and if the fonts are hosted by Google, it says &#8220;Google Fonts Connection Found&#8221; with a red &#8216;X.&#8217; Sites that are in the clear will show a notice that a Google Fonts connection was not found:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Google Fonts Checker is useful for non-technical users who are not sure whether their theme or plugins are referencing fonts hosted on Google&#8217;s servers. Beyond delivering the simple connection message, the tool scans the website and returns a list of the font files used to render the page, which can be helpful in tracking down the specific extension loading these files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 200,000 people are using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/olympus-google-fonts/\">Fonts Plugin</a> to load assets from the Google Fonts Library. Although the Google Fonts Checker tool is free to use and doesn&#8217;t require any personal information or login, the free version of the Fonts Plugin doesn&#8217;t support hosting fonts locally. Users will either need to upgrade to the commercial version or use a different plugin, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/\">Local Google Fonts</a> or the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/\">OMGF | Host Google Fonts Locally</a> plugin, both of which perform this for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who find a Google Fonts connection using the tool may also consider switching to <a href=\"https://fonts.bunny.net/\">Bunny Fonts</a>, an open-source, privacy-first web font platform with no tracking or logging that is fully GDPR compliant. It can act as a drop-in replacement to Google Fonts.

A <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985\">ticket</a> for bundling the fonts with the legacy default themes had patches and was on track to be included in WordPress 6.1, but ended up getting <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-punts-locally-hosted-fonts-for-legacy-default-themes-to-6-2-release\">punted to a future release</a> after it was determined the approach needed more work.

The blog went into beta at the end of last week and resides on a subdomain of the main site. It is sporting a design similar to WordPress&#8217; general News blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/01/21/big-picture-goals-2022/\">big picture goals</a> that WordPress&#8217; Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy identified for 2022 was the creation of a developer-focused communications site. This new blog is the culmination of an effort that began earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Staying on top of the new features coming to the WordPress open-source project is one of the main barriers expressed by developers,&#8221; contributor Birgit Pauli-Haack said in the original <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/02/25/proposal-to-start-a-news-blog-on-developer-wordpress-org/\">proposal</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The Make Core blog has a heavy emphasis on meeting notes for the various core teams, rather than highlighting new features. This makes it difficult for developers who are not contributors or who just occasionally contribute to find the relevant information among the team-related posts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content on the new developer blog will be focused on updates applicable to theme and plugin creators, developers who work at agencies, Gutenberg API updates, advanced programming concepts, PHP gems, and developer case studies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> There are already three posts published, which offer a hint at what kind of content WordPress developers can expect on the blog:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2022/11/18/how-to-extend-wordpress-via-the-slotfill-system/\">How to extend WordPress via the SlotFill system</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2022/11/17/demystifying-home-and-posts-templates-in-wordpress-theme-development/\">Demystifying Home and Posts Templates in WordPress theme development</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2022/11/17/creating-themes-from-a-pattern-first-mindset/\">Creating Themes from a Pattern-First Mindset</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The blog&#8217;s editorial process is being entirely <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content\">managed on GitHub</a> from pitches to publication. Anyone who wants to contribute can post to the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/developer-blog-content/discussions/categories/ideas\">Ideas board</a> for discussion.

The event format is similar to last year where a small group of invited guests will join in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, the State of the Word has been given at WordCamp US, capping off the event with an inspiring review of WordPress&#8217; progress and a lively Q&amp;A session. Starting in 2020, due to the pandemic, the SOTW transitioned to a separate, smaller event that can be broadcast to all who cannot attend. Organizers are planning to livestream this year&#8217;s event across WordPress.org&#8217;s social media platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike last year, where prominent members of the community were invited to attend, organizers have created a form where anyone can <a href=\"https://wordcampcentral.survey.fm/request-a-seat-sotw-2022\">request an invitation to attend</a>. Seats are available to the public on a first-come, first-served basis. The form states that masks will not be required at the event, a policy that is as controversial today as it was last year, and makes it impossible for medically vulnerable people to attend:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;While at the event, masks are not mandatory but encouraged, as is using hand sanitizer and social distancing.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the majority of people will be watching via live stream, the Q&amp;A portion of the event will be handled via email for virtual participants. Anyone can ask a question in advance by emailing ask-matt@wordcamp.org or may ask during the event in the live stream chat on YouTube. WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden-Chomphosy said there may be a follow-up post published with answers to questions not covered at the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The live stream will be embedded in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/state-of-the-word-2022/\">announcement post</a> and will also air on <a href=\"https://youtube.com/wordpress\">WordPress&#8217; YouTube channel</a> on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/eventedit?text=State+of+the+Word+2022&dates=20221215T180000Z/20221215T193000Z&details=State+of+the+Word+is+the+annual+keynote+address+delivered+by+the+WordPress+project%E2%80%99s+co-founder%2C+Matt+Mullenweg.+Every+year%2C+the+event+shares+reflections+on+the+project%E2%80%99s+progress+and+the+future+of+open+source.+Expect+this+and+more+in+this+year%E2%80%99s+edition.%0A%0AState+of+the+Word+will+be+live+streamed+from+New+York+City,+and+is+free+for+all+to+watch.%0A%0Ahttps://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/state-of-the-word-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">December 15, 2022, at 1–2:30 P.M.
